ripped through the wall and into the hallway.XYFNKWChunks of.concrete and wood flew everywhere..Kade was rocked backward by the blast as he neared the lab and.hit the wall hard.XYFNKWThe blow knocked the wind from him as he crumpled to the ground.XYFNKWHis ears rang, his vision blurred, and he could smell smoke and saw the.flicker of a fire down the hall across from where the lab was.XYFNKWKade heard the alarms ring out and felt the cool spray of the sprinkler systems as they were activated from the heat of the fire.XYFNKWThe downpour soaked his white lab coat in a matter of seconds..He tried to get up, but the room tilted and whirled around him and his feet slid out from under him.XYFNKWHis head hurt and the hallway spun.XYFNKWHe tried to shake.off the dizziness and, as his vision started to come around, he noticed a figure exit from the lab.XYFNKWThe person was dressed all in black and Kade saw that he was.coming his way stepping over the rubble and nimbly working his way carefully.down the hall.XYFNKWKade tried again to rise, but he couldn’t.XYFNKWPain throbbed in the back of his head and neck.XYFNKWIt was no use he felt as though all the strength in him was sapped out.XYFNKWAll he could do was lean against the wall and hope that help would come soon..The intruder strode down the hall and stood above Kade, looking down at him.XYFNKWThe man’s face was hidden by a mask so that he couldn’t make out who it.was.XYFNKWAs the figure looked at him he could sense somehow that he was smirking..beneath the dark mask.XYFNKWThe only thing that Kade could see were those piercing.dark eyes as the unknown man stared intently at him..Kade feebly reached his hand out at the man in the mask but the dark figure.swatted it away.XYFNKWHe was about to continue to move down the hallway, but suddenly stopped.XYFNKWHe looked back at the battered man for an instant before shooting his hand out and backhanding Kade across the face..The stinging blow hit him with such force that it sent his head rocking to the.side.XYFNKWThe dizziness intensified as he felt the sharp crack of the man’s hand.XYFNKWHe tried to shake it off, and even attempted to stand again, but the darkness started to overcome him.XYFNKWHis strength was gone.XYFNKWHe slumped back against the wall and.faded from consciousness..KADE!XYFNKWKADE!XYFNKWHE HEARD A WOMAN’S VOICE YELL AT HIM AS HIS EYES.flickered open.XYFNKWHis head pounded and his vision was blurry as he began to wake..As his eyes focused he saw the face of Trina staring at him concern etched across those delicate features..Quick!XYFNKWI need medical help here!XYFNKWshe turned and called out to any first responder that was near..By this time the sprinklers were shut off and the smoke had cleared from he.hall.XYFNKWAre you okay?XYFNKWshe turned back and asked her friend..He nodded slightly as he tried to rise but then fell back.XYFNKWI think so, he managed to say..What happened?I … I don’t know, Kade replied.XYFNKWI was heading to the lab when suddenly.—the man!XYFNKWThere was a man leaving the lab!XYFNKWDid he take anything?XYFNKWWhat’s missing?Kade, I need you to focus.XYFNKWWhat did this man look like?He was … he was tall.XYFNKWNo, I was laying on the ground.XYFNKWKade rubbed his forehead.XYFNKWThe details in his mind were as jumbled as the rubble around him.XYFNKWI.think he liked that I was hurt...Trina’s eyes closed, as if in prayer.XYFNKWKade, what did he look like?Blackness, Kade whispered..Trina moved aside while a rescuer came over and started to assess the man..What did he get?XYFNKWKade asked again, concern evident in his voice..Trina shook her head slightly.XYFNKWWe don’t know yet, she replied.XYFNKWOur teams.are trying to determine if anyone was killed in the blast first..Dr.XYFNKWJohnson!XYFNKWKade suddenly exclaimed as he tried to rise once more.XYFNKWThe.EMT put a hand on his shoulder and settled him back.XYFNKWPlease tell me that Johnson is okay!Trina was silent.XYFNKWKade’s eyes went wide as he realized what Trina was telling.him in her silence.XYFNKWA tear streaked his face..You need to rest, the rescuer said as another one came over with a stretcher.XYFNKWWe need to get you to the hospital..Kade nodded weakly as he wiped the tear from his face..Trina put her hand on his arm.XYFNKWDon’t worry.XYFNKWWe’ll tell you everything as soon as we have more information, she said..She stood up as the men hoisted Kade onto the stretcher.XYFNKWBefore they wheeled him away, he grabbed Trina’s arm and looked up at her, desperation in.his eyes..You need to do whatever it takes to get these guys, he declared.XYFNKWWhatever.it takes!XYFNKWFor Johnson..TRINA WALKED INTO THE LAB A FEW HOURS LATER WITH A FORENSIC EXPERT WHO.was trying to determine all the elements which played a factor in the recent events.XYFNKWShe could see overturned tables, pieces of equipment that were blown apart, and some stains of blood where Dr.XYFNKWJohnson had been found.XYFNKWFortunately,.the invasion happened a few hours after Trichem Labs officially closed for the day and most of the staff had already left for the evening..We’re conducting an autopsy on the body of Dr.XYFNKWJohnson in order to.determine if he was killed before the explosion, or if that was the cause of.death, the forensic expert stated matter-of-factly..Why did you have to be so committed to your work?XYFNKWTrina whispered to herself as she stooped down and examined the floor where they found Johnson’s.body..What was that?Oh … nothing, she replied..The lab looked like it was something out of a war movie.XYFNKWShe glanced up to.where the security cameras were positioned.XYFNKWSome of them looked scarred and burned.XYFNKWDid those get any relevant footage of the event?We’re looking at the recordings now, but so far there’s nothing conclusive..Nothing conclusive!XYFNKWshe exclaimed as anger brimmed her voice.XYFNKWHow can.we have perfectly good security systems and not know what we’re dealing with.here?Our Crime Scene Investigation Team is on it, he replied sternly.XYFNKWIf there’s.something of note, we’ll find it..Sorry, she replied softly.XYFNKWDo you mind if I take a look around by myself?Sure thing.XYFNKWJust try not to disturb anything..Trina nodded..Trichem labs was desperate to find out who had done this.XYFNKWAnd Trina was pretty sure she knew why they had done it as she approached the walk-in refrigeration unit..The unit was recessed into the concrete wall which made it a perfect spot to.escape from an explosion.XYFNKWIt’s massive steel door that was singed and scratched.on the outside was slightly ajar.XYFNKWShe opened it the rest of the way and stepped inside, surveying the many different vials that lined the shelves.XYFNKWShe stopped half way down and looked at the empty rack that was conspicuously evident with the.label underneath it which read: Genesis..She gasped and shook her head.XYFNKWShe squeezed her eyes shut and opened them.again, hoping she had seen wrong the first time.XYFNKWBut she hadn’t.XYFNKWGenesis was gone.XYFNKWShe knew that whoever had taken this chemical compound had a force in.their hands that was more powerful than anything they could imagine.XYFNKWThey probably didn’t even realize the extent to which it could be used she hoped they.didn’t realize the extent to which it could be used..She knew they had to get it back.XYFNKWThey had to do whatever it took..She had but one recourse even though it unsettled her: It was time to call in.the Orion Group....2.T H E WA T C H.The day was overcast with dark clouds looming threatening to pour.down its wrath at any moment.XYFNKWDillon hurried across the street and.into the dark forest.XYFNKWHis dog Bruno, a large playful German Shepherd,.followed close behind, sniffing every second tree as he went.XYFNKWThis place held special significance for Dillon it was where his most thrilling adventures took place.XYFNKWWhenever he was over here, Dillon could pretend to be anything.XYFNKWAnd today.XYFNKWToday, Dillon was a fearless adventurer, in search of the lost treasure of The Ancient Skull!As Dillon stepped into the dark forest, the area around him transformed in his mind’s eye.XYFNKWNo longer was it filled with thick pine, fir, and spruce trees, but now he was overshadowed by the dark canopy of the tropical Amazon forest..He looked around at his surroundings, taking careful stock of where he was.he knew that every forward scout would tell you that it’s all too easy to lose your bearings in this kind of thick, desolate forest..The air was dank, filled with the moisture of a recent rain.XYFNKWAs he moved carefully through the trees, following the small trail he had unearthed, he noticed the tracks he had been looking for!XYFNKWI knew it was true!XYFNKWhe thought to himself..For years everyone had told him that the Amazon creatures known as the Giant Hape Crushers were just a fantasy a myth that was created to keep people.from exploring this part of the forest.XYFNKWBut now Dillon knew it was not!XYFNKWFor right in front of him were the very tracks that proved his theory.XYFNKWAnd they were fresh!He knew this could only mean one thing: he was close to the fortress of the Ancient Skull, the legendary city of monsters, which held such gold and glory for the one who could find it.XYFNKWOh … and also danger and possible death.XYFNKWThat was okay with Dillon though as he knew the risks.XYFNKWHe had trained all his life for this moment.XYFNKWA little danger wasn’t going to stop him now!Suddenly there was a massive sound of crashing trees and low guttural grunts as something huge barrelled through the trees toward him.XYFNKWHe quickly dived to the side and rolled off the path and through the brush, landing firmly on his feet in a ready stance.XYFNKWSliding his long slender sabre from its sheath he readied himself for the fight..The creature blew through the trees with ferocity, sending leaves everywhere.and splintering branches from their perch upon the Amazon trunks.XYFNKWIt was huge.much taller than Dillon.XYFNKWEven though it was slightly hunched Dillon could tell that it was at least eight feet in height.XYFNKWIt had the face of a man but the teeth of a gorilla.XYFNKWIts huge mass was ripped with muscle, and the way it stood and walked.resembled that of an ape.XYFNKWIts upper body was hairless while its lower body had.thick ape-hair all over it.XYFNKWHe had to dive out of the way in order to avoid being crushed under the massive hulk of the beast and the flying debris it has caused!He rolled around and slashed at the back of the creature’s legs but the beast’s.hide was too thick to do any damage.XYFNKWIt turned around and Dillon saw its terrible red eyes boring into him.XYFNKWIt roared.XYFNKWSpittle sprayed from its mouth as it issued its challenge.XYFNKWAnd its breath!XYFNKWOh the stench!XYFNKWDespite the frightening nature of the creature Dillon’s resolve to make it to the fortress of The Ancient Skull was not deterred.XYFNKWDillon’s resolve to fight his way through was at its height..It came in with its fangs barred, but Dillon nimbly dodged out of the way and.delivered another blow, this time in the thigh.XYFNKWClearly it was irritated as it roared spit issuing from its foul mouth … again.XYFNKWDillon laughed.XYFNKWThat must have confused the dim-witted creature, for it looked at him with a puzzled expression on its face.XYFNKWThis gave Dillon the opportunity he needed to dive gracefully around the side of the creature, roll, and come up in a dead run down the path as he sheathed his sword.XYFNKWDillon knew now that he couldn’t fight this thing on even ground.XYFNKWIt was eight feet tall with razor sharp fangs, and breath that rivalled even.his little sister Gwen’s when she woke up in the morning!No, for now, he was content running through the woods like a maniac, seeking for some advantage he could use against the beast.XYFNKWAnd there it was: the bridge of Kazakdoon!The bridge stood about thirty feet long and spanned a gulf that was at least a.thousand feet deep!As he started to run across the bridge he began to feel the sway of it and the.warm wind on his face.XYFNKWDillon knew that he was in more trouble than he first realized when, at the half way point of the bridge, he heard the roar of the Giant Hape Crusher as it crashed through the trees and onto the bridge.XYFNKWThe sudden jolt of its weight sent Dillon flying into the air, but he somehow managed to land on his feet and kept running.XYFNKWAs he glanced back he saw the monstrous creature bounding towards him with such ferocity that it drained the blood from his face..Dillon’s heart pounded.XYFNKWThe beast was gaining on him and it was pretty clear.that he might not make it to the other side in time.XYFNKWAs he ran, he realized that the only way he might make it was to leap from the bridge and hope that he was close enough to the other side for his momentum to propel him far enough to the.ledge of the cliff..Dillon could almost feel the hot breath of the beast on his back which made.him realize that it was now or never.XYFNKWHe pumped his legs as fast as he could, drawing on all the resources his body could muster—pressing himself to the limit—trying to make up as much distance as he could before the jump.XYFNKWHe glanced back for a moment and saw the creature reach out for him.XYFNKWHe leaped with all his might..The Giant Hape Crusher lunged for him as he sprang into the air its long stocky fingers brushing the back of the air-borne adventurer’s shirt.XYFNKWAs Dillon flew from the bridge he took note of the clump of vines that sprouted from the.edge of the cliff.XYFNKWHe knew that those vines were the best shot of him getting out of this alive.XYFNKWHe slammed into the side of the cliff and desperately grasped onto any of the corded plants he could.XYFNKWAs he hit the edge of the cliff he smashed his knee on the rocky face, but it barely phased him as he knew he had bigger problems to deal with—like not falling a thousand feet to his death!Thankfully the vines seemed to hold.XYFNKWHe glanced back over his shoulder to see the Giant Hape Crusher staring at him in disbelief.XYFNKWIt howled wildly, not sure of how to proceed.XYFNKWLuckily, because of the momentum he gathered from the run,.Dillon landed only a few feet short from the top of the ledge.XYFNKWQuickly he scrambled up the cliff before the dumb creature realized that it was still within striking distance of the kid if it hurried off the bridge..The agile adventurer scrambled to the top, looked back, and smirked at the dumbfounded creature who scratched its head stupidly..See ya!XYFNKWDillon yelled as he took off again through the trees, a little bit slower this time due to his banged-up knee.XYFNKWThe wild scream that the Giant Hape.Crusher issued told Dillon that the stupid creature just realized it could still chase him, and was probably doing just that..Dillon wound through the path once more with as much haste as he could muster, but the stubborn creature was still pursuing as he could hear the trees crashing aside as the beast plowed through..I have to find a spot to hide, he thought to himself as he suddenly realized that there was no way of out running this thing even without his banged up knee.XYFNKWBesides, Dillon also had to admit to himself that he was starting to get really tired and needed to rest soon..Just then, as he stumbled through a small creek, he saw what looked like a.small hole in the side of a hill that had an overhang of vines coming down from.it.XYFNKWQuickly he dashed inside, and not a moment too soon!XYFNKWFor, as soon as he had.touched the back wall to the small make-shift cave, the beast came bounding through the trees and into the creek.XYFNKWIt continued to move on, about to step into the tree line beyond where Dillon was hiding, when it suddenly stopped.XYFNKWIt lifted its nose into the air and sniffed around as though it had been tracking him by his scent this whole time..Dillon froze, not even daring to breathe.XYFNKWHe had his hands planted against the.back of the hole and, as he was trying to readjust just a little in order to ensure that he was fully hidden, his hand grasped something that was lodged behind a.root.XYFNKWIt felt small and smooth.XYFNKWDillon didn’t have time to examine it, so he pulled it out and quickly placed it into his pocket..The beast came back toward the creek with its nose in the air.XYFNKWIt sniffed around, up and then down, and then it looked in the young adventurer’s direction.XYFNKWIts red eyes bored down toward the small hideout.XYFNKWDillon could see through small openings in the overhanging vines that the creature probably knew.he was there.XYFNKWSlowly it stalked over as it continued to sniff.XYFNKWIt was made starkly clear at that moment that there was no way out of this except to fight, no matter how futile that might be.XYFNKWHe quickly slid his finely crafted sabre from its sheath as the creature approached.XYFNKWWhen it was about ten feet away Dillon stepped slowly and calmly from his would-be hideout.XYFNKWThe two locked eyes and the creature hunched down and snarled, ready to charge.XYFNKWDillon positioned himself in the best defensive stance he could and awaited the rush..The Giant Hape Crusher roared one last time and then lunged!XYFNKWThe agile warrior came up with the sabre leading and then … off in the distance Dillon heard a distinctive call, Dillon!XYFNKWIt’s time for dinner!XYFNKWThe call was faint, but brought the young boy back to reality.XYFNKWThe beast was almost upon him.XYFNKWIt closed.in and then … Dillon felt the lick of its floppy tongue on his face.XYFNKWIt knocked him down as it playfully licked him all over..Okay okay!XYFNKWDillon said to his dog, Bruno.XYFNKWYou got me!XYFNKWAh!XYFNKWThe fierce Giant Hape Crusher has triumphed!XYFNKWDillon laughed as he pushed his dog away..Bruno growled playfully and issued a bark as he pushed him off.XYFNKWSorry boy,.but it’s time for dinner.XYFNKWLet’s go!Bruno bounded after the young adventurer as he led the way back through the small forest and onto Glenview street.XYFNKWDillon’s house was literally right across the road from this most awesome play zone as he always called it..Unfortunately, there weren’t many other kids in the neighbourhood who found it.as enjoyable as he did.XYFNKWBut that was okay.XYFNKWDillon was content as he always had.Bruno to play the other roles in their adventures.XYFNKWSometimes he actually pretended that Bruno was a giant wolf that he saved in one way or other, and that he was bound to serve and protect him as they hunted for treasure and lost artifacts..As he walked toward his house he pulled the object he had found from his pocket.XYFNKWHe held it up in front of him and turned it over in his hand.XYFNKWIt looked like.it was a small pocket watch.XYFNKWCool!XYFNKWhe thought, as he examined it.XYFNKWIt was really tarnished and dirty, and the chain that was supposed to be attached to it was missing.XYFNKWIt had a few dings on it and when he pushed the button in order to open it he had to pry it a bit before it unlatched.XYFNKWThe inside was plain, the face of the watch was faded, and the hands were missing..What’s goin on today little man?XYFNKWMom asked, as he walk into the.driveway, breaking him from his thoughts of curiosity concerning the watch..Come on Mom!XYFNKWI’m taller than you now!XYFNKWDillon complained as he closed.up the watch and placed it back in his pocket..Mom just smiled her soft, almost mischievous smile, she always had when she was trying to get a rise out of one of her kids..Dillon shrugged it off and offered a smile back of his own.XYFNKWNothing much,.he responded.XYFNKWYou know … just hunting for the lost fortress of The Ancient Skull, he finished with an expressive flourish of his hands..That’s nice, Mom responded without missing a beat or thinking anything was weird about his statement.XYFNKWDon’t forget to wash your hands for dinner..Really mom!XYFNKWI’m twelve you know!Sorry, honey.XYFNKWYou still have to wash your hands..No problem, Dillon responded with a shrug..As Dillon headed to the bathroom to wash up for dinner his little sister, Gwen, raced up to him and wrapped her arms around his waist.XYFNKWHey Dragon Breath!XYFNKWWhat’s that for?XYFNKWhe asked..I just missed hanging out with you and being part of your crazy adventures!XYFNKWshe said, a huge smile cresting her bright face.XYFNKWCan we play one after dinner?I don’t know … I am pretty busy with homework..Her lips quivered as she gave Dillon a sad look..He smiled back.XYFNKWOkay, maybe just for a bit..Gwen gave him another huge hug and jumped back excitedly.XYFNKWMaybe we.can finish finding the mysterious treasure of woe?Is that what we called it?XYFNKWhe asked.XYFNKWWe’ve gotta think up a better name than that!.Gwen’s smile seemed almost permanent at this point.XYFNKWDid you find any treasures?XYFNKWshe asked..Not much.XYFNKWJust this old pocket watch and a five dollar bill, he said as he.pulled the money from his pocket..Gwen looked at the money with admiration.XYFNKWNot much?XYFNKWThat’s great!Well, if you like it so much then how about you keep the five dollars..Gwen almost fell over.XYFNKWDon’t you want it?XYFNKWshe asked..No, I would rather have this old watch.XYFNKWI imagine it used to be the property.of someone important long ago.XYFNKWIt might even have a hidden map, or a clue to even greater treasure stuck inside somewhere..Wow, Gwen mouthed as she stared at the prize..Or maybe it’s just an old watch, Dillon said, shrugging.XYFNKWBut let’s pretend.it is the holder of a map, he ended with a grin..Gwen nodded her head eagerly.XYFNKWYou always find the coolest stuff, she said.with abounding admiration.XYFNKWHow come?I don't know.XYFNKWJust lucky I guess.XYFNKWDillon looked down at the watch and turned it over in his hand.XYFNKWHe didn’t understand it, but he just had this feeling that this watch was important somehow.XYFNKWHe just didn’t know why.XYFNKWHe looked up and smiled at Gwen and shrugged before moving passed her.XYFNKWMaybe his.imagination was getting the best of him, he thought, as he chuckled to himself..JAKE WATCHED DEREK WALK BACK TO THEIR CAR AS HE ROUNDED THE CORNER..His leg jiggled a little with nerves.XYFNKWIf he was wrong about the kid … He took a.deep breath and composed his face.XYFNKWJust in case this was the right kid, Jake purposely parked around the corner, out of the way of the view of Dillon’s house.XYFNKWHe didn’t want any possibility of Dillon observing them and blowing their cover.XYFNKWIt seemed silly on a rational level, but he knew he wasn’t dealing with rationality here if Dillon was their boy..Well?XYFNKWhe asked as Derek settled in the passenger’s seat.XYFNKWHow did it go?Did he see you?.No he didn’t see me, Derek responded.XYFNKWI made sure of that.XYFNKWI have to tell.you though, I was pretty skeptical about your assessment of this kid.XYFNKWBut it went better than I thought it would.XYFNKWHe took his ball cap off to reveal a cleanly shaven head right to the scalp.XYFNKWOn the right side of his head he had Japanese Kana characters tattooed, but never told anyone what they meant.XYFNKWWhenever anyone asked him about it he just got quiet and either changed the subject or walked away..That’s encouraging news, Jake replied with a smile.XYFNKWWhat happened?Well … when you told me that you thought this kid had some sort of luck in finding objects that others would pass by, even if they were well hidden I thought you were exaggerating, Derek said.XYFNKWSo I decided to test your little theory and I hid it in a place that no one should have found it..Where?XYFNKWasked Jake, intrigued..Derek, looking down at his cap, paused for a moment, then looked up and met Jake’s waiting gaze.XYFNKWI hid the watch in a natural alcove that had some tree roots growing down over the hole.XYFNKWIn the alcove I buried it behind some more roots and moss.XYFNKWThat thing should have stayed hidden for ever..Jake smiled.XYFNKWI think we’ve found our kid, he said as he reached over and.turned the key in the ignition..DILLON LAY IN HIS BED LATER THAT NIGHT STARING UP AT THE STRANGE WATCH.he had found.XYFNKWIt didn’t work anymore.XYFNKWHe rubbed at it with the sleeve of his pyjama shirt, trying to clean the dirt and stains off of it.XYFNKWAs he rubbed he noticed that there was some sort of writing on the back.XYFNKWHe reached over and pulled his.night lamp closer so he could get a better look at it.XYFNKWIt was really hard to read, but, after a few moments he managed to make out the letters JTS.XYFNKWJTS he mouthed silently.XYFNKWHe opened the watch up again and turned it around in his hands a few more times, looking for anything else he could see that was out of.the ordinary.XYFNKWThe fact that the hands were missing was definitely strange.XYFNKWHe considered the letters for a few moments more.XYFNKWDillon was sure that, if this.watch could talk, it would have a tale to tell that would make his own adventures seem lame in comparison!XYFNKWHis mind drifted to fantastical imaginations of far off lands and amazing feats of heroism.XYFNKWHe laughed to himself..Sure, he thought.XYFNKWIt was probably just some old man’s junk that he threw out when he couldn’t find any replacement hands!Still, he couldn’t help but wonder if there was something more.XYFNKWHe couldn’t.explain it but he just had this feeling about this watch..He suddenly heard footsteps coming down the hall towards his room..Quickly, he put the watch down, shut off the lights, and tucked himself under the covers, narrowly avoiding the mom talk about going to sleep promptly..As he drifted off to sleep he smiled to himself as his mind started working out all the possible origins of the watch, a few of those thoughts even followed him into his dreams....3.C H O C O L A T E.Dillon and his friends walked onto the playground with confidence and.expectation.XYFNKWThey had thirty minutes left in their lunch break in order.to continue their adventures of the high seas.XYFNKWAs they climbed onto the.Jungle Gym it transformed in their minds into a huge wooden ship that swayed.back and forth, being tossed to and fro by the pounding of the swells of the ocean..The boat threatened to come apart as it was hammered by the roaring waves..The crew might have felt better about their circumstances if they weren’t being.boarded by pirates!XYFNKWThey were warned that this part of the sea was full of them, but the chance to be the ones who found the lost isle of the Dawn Breaker was.too much temptation for the crew of six.XYFNKWTheir Captain, Colton Drake, was sure.they could make it despite the warnings that were given to them before they embarked..The pirates came on in a fury.XYFNKWFirst mate, Chet Williams, narrowly dodged a.wicked looking jagged pirate blade before coming back with a strike of his own..He scored a hit on the pirate’s side the sea dog grimaced and fell back a step..Williams smiled slightly, then his look turned to surprise as the pirate returned to the battle with the same fury as the storm that rocked the boat..Williams worked his blade feverishly, matching blow with parry, parry with.blow neither scoring a hit.XYFNKWThe ring of their blades was heard above that of the roar of the storm.XYFNKWThe pirate pushed Williams back to the side of the ship with..his ferocity.XYFNKWTheir blades locked and Williams could smell the stench of the pirate’s breath as he moved in close, hoping to overpower the sailor.XYFNKWWilliams thought he was about to perish when suddenly the pirate’s eyes opened wide in.disbelief and his press upon Williams slackened just before he fell to the deck.XYFNKWIn the dark night Williams could see the face of his Captain standing there..You alright?XYFNKWCaptain Drake asked..Williams nodded.XYFNKWHe and Drake looked around, then leaped back into the fray in order to help the rest of the crew.XYFNKWAs he fought off the pirates, Captain Drake would take any reprieve he could to glance at his compass in order to make sure that the ship was still on course, despite the battle..CHECK THIS OUT GUYS, SAID JASON, A STALKY SIXTH GRADER, TO HIS FOUR.friends who were just hanging out by the school fence talking about the latest you-tuber as they ate lunch..They all turned and watched as they saw Dillon and five younger grade kids.jumping all over the Jungle Gym, pretending to dodge blows and battle some unseen foes.XYFNKWThe guys started chuckling..Man, is that kid ever weird, said one of Jason’s friends..Ya … no doubt, Jason replied as he started walking toward the playground..What are you doin man?XYFNKWasked another of his friends..Jason turned to regard him and smiled.XYFNKWI’m just gonna have some fun, he.responded..There were other kids watching the display from a distance but didn’t seem.to mind.XYFNKWFrom time-to-time another smaller kid or two would come up and start.playing with the crew.XYFNKWDillon welcomed anyone who wanted to engage in the adventure..He noticed Jason and his gang approaching but continued the adventure.anyway, knowing that it was probably about to come to an end..Sure enough.XYFNKWAs Jason walked up he pushed one of the younger kids out of.the way.XYFNKWThe kid sprawled out onto the grass and rolled a couple of times before.coming to a stop.XYFNKWImmediately Dillon jumped off the equipment and met Jason face-to-face..Hey man!XYFNKWWhy don’t you leave us alone, he said, getting between Jason and the rest of his crew..I just thought you might want some real people to fight, Jason said with a sneer..No, we’re okay with the pirates of the Glass Sea, responded Dillon..The what?XYFNKWJason asked incredulously..The pirates of the Glass Sea, Dillon said matter-of-factly.XYFNKWDon’t tell me you’ve never heard of them?XYFNKWThey’re infamous for their murderous rage.XYFNKWThey seek vessels to attack and pillage, murdering all in their way and hoarding all the treasure they acquire..You’re weird man, stated Jason, a tone of condescension in his voice..I know.XYFNKWIt is strange that we use our imaginations to entertain ourselves..You’ve heard of that?XYFNKWHaven’t you?Of course I have you nerd!XYFNKWexclaimed Jason indignantly..Then maybe you would like to join us?XYFNKWoffered Dillon..Jason shook his head slightly, unable to mask the disgust he had on his face..Man, I could beat the crap out of you if I wanted.XYFNKWBut you’re not worth my time.XYFNKWThis thing, though?XYFNKWhe said as he noticed the watch in Dillon’s hand..Quickly, before Dillon could react, he snatched it from him.XYFNKWWhat’s this?XYFNKWhe asked in a taunting voice..Hey man, not cool!XYFNKWDillon responded.XYFNKWThat’s mine!Hunt, your family’s so poor your parents can’t even afford a proper watch.for you!, Jason exclaimed as he held it up.XYFNKWDillon tried to grab it back, but Jason quickly pulled it away and shoved Dillon hard in the chest.XYFNKWDillon stumbled back, but was able to maintain his footing..Jason’s crew was quick to look around and see if any of the recess monitors.had noticed what was going on.XYFNKWThey hadn’t.XYFNKWFortunately for Jason the playground was packed and the monitors were all preoccupied: some with other.kids some talking to one another and one monitor, Mrs Jacobs, apparently thought there were more interesting things going on in the world of social media.as she had her face glued to her phone..It looks worthless, said Jason.XYFNKWLet’s see if it is..Before Dillon could try and grab at it again Jason threw it as hard as he could.behind the playground and into … Miss Kettle’s yard!XYFNKWDillon, and all the kids who had witnessed this, were horror struck..Miss Kettle’s yard backed onto the school property and all the kids avoided.her part of the fence like the plague.XYFNKWThis was due to her dog, Chocolate.XYFNKWThe name she gave her dog didn’t seem to match the dog itself except for maybe its.color.XYFNKWChocolate was a massive Rottweiler-Husky cross with dark brown fur.XYFNKWHis.bark was enough to scare the bravest of the kids at school.XYFNKWHe didn’t show himself very often, but when someone ventured too close to the fence he would,.most-times, let out a deep-throated bark that seemed to shake the very air.XYFNKWThe worst part was that Miss Kettle’s yard was full of trees, plants, and shrubs which made it perfect for Chocolate to conceal himself so you wouldn’t know he was.even there until it was too late..Dillon stood there in a daze.XYFNKWIn an instant it seemed like the entire playground went silent.XYFNKWYou could hear a pin drop at that moment.XYFNKWThe slight breeze, which before now was not even noticeable, seemed like a torrent at that.moment..You jerk!XYFNKWscreamed Sarah—another sixth grader with medium length.brown hair, and one of Dillon’s best friends—as she moved closer to Jason and.Dillon..Jason merely laughed..Dillon started walking toward the yard..What are you doing?XYFNKWasked Sarah as she grabbed his arm.XYFNKWYou’re not seriously thinking about going in there are you?XYFNKWshe pressed..Dillon pulled his arm away.XYFNKWI have to, he said as he turned to look her in.the eyes..Why?I … I don’t know, he responded hesitantly.XYFNKWBut I need to get that watch back..Why don’t you just wait until after school and go ask Miss Kettle to get it.back for you instead of risking your life for a stupid broken watch you found in the forest?XYFNKWSarah reasoned..I can’t wait.XYFNKWI can’t lose it.XYFNKWWhat if the dog get’s it first?XYFNKWHis voice was verging on the edge of desperation.XYFNKWHis tone stopped Sarah in her tracks for a moment..Jason laughed again as he began to walk away.XYFNKWYou’re as stupid as you look.Hunt!Sarah snapped her head around and gave Jason a cold look.XYFNKWHe sneered at her, waved his hand dismissively, and continued walking.XYFNKWCome on guys, he said to the rest of his posse.XYFNKWThey hesitated, unsure of what they should do.XYFNKWI said come on!XYFNKWhe reiterated forcefully.XYFNKWThat was enough to get them going..By the time Sarah looked back, Dillon was halfway to the fence.XYFNKWThe other.kids who, a moment earlier were hanging out with him on the Jungle Gym, looked to one another for a second and then began to follow.XYFNKWSarah ran to catch.up with him..Dillon!XYFNKWshe whispered emphatically as they got closer to the fence..Dillon quickly waved his hand in a downward motion indicating that he wanted her to be quiet.XYFNKWHe stood by the fence for a moment and listened..Everyone was deadly silent.XYFNKWThe only sound that could be heard was the light breeze that moved through the trees and brush of Miss Kettle’s yard, ruffling the leaves and branches as it went..Dillon grabbed the top of the chain-linked fence.XYFNKWSarah touched his shoulder..He turned and met her eyes, noting the concern he could see in them.XYFNKWIt’ll be okay, he whispered to her.XYFNKWWith that, he quickly leaped over the fence and into the yard.XYFNKWEvery kid watching held their breath, not daring to make a sound..Dillon made his way quickly across the small clearing that led to the edge of.the trees and bushes which covered Miss Kettle’s yard.XYFNKWHe then crouched down.and slipped under the closest overhang of branches and disappeared under the overgrowth.XYFNKWAs silent as he could he maneuvered through the yard, trying to remember roughly where he saw the watch go down.XYFNKWAs he snuck along he was.careful to listen for any sound that Chocolate might make.XYFNKWHe noted some deadfall under the trees and picked up a one inch thick branch that was about.three feet long, just in case.XYFNKWHe came through the thick brush and noted a large doghouse in front of him and to the right.XYFNKWHe scanned the yard to see if he could spot the dog anywhere.XYFNKWAll was clear.XYFNKWAs he was repositioning himself he suddenly heard some movement coming from within the doghouse.XYFNKWHe froze, not.daring to even breathe.XYFNKWHe waited for what seemed an eternity, but nothing happened.XYFNKWNo dog.XYFNKWHe’s probably sleeping, Dillon thought.XYFNKWI hope he’s sleeping!As he continued to scan around he noted the glint of an object as the sun reflected off of it.XYFNKWIt was the watch!XYFNKWDillon’s best guess was that the watch had cleared the trees and landed about ten feet from the edge of the brush into the yard five feet from the entrance to the doghouse..Man.XYFNKWJason has a great arm!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWThat kid should really focus on using it for good not evil.XYFNKWDillon shook his head in order to focus his attention back to the task at hand.XYFNKWGet the watch, he thought to himself.XYFNKWGet the watch..He kneeled at the edge of the tree-line, reached down and grabbed a handful.of dead leaves, and sprinkled them lightly so that he could get a sense of the wind direction.XYFNKWThe wind was blowing back the way he had come, which meant.that it was blowing, more-or-less, away from the doghouse..Dillon knew that he had to act sooner than later.XYFNKWSlowly he began to creep toward the watch, walking in a crouched position, watching carefully where he.placed each foot as he moved.XYFNKWHe was almost there when he noticed a slight change in his environment.XYFNKWHe felt the wind shift ever-so-slightly as the hair on the back of his head moved in that direction the direction of the doghouse.XYFNKWHis heart started to pound, threatening to burst from his chest.XYFNKWThen he heard it.XYFNKWThe low growl that drained the blood from his face.XYFNKWSlowly, he looked up to see Chocolate crouched low in his doghouse and starring at him with those deep brown eyes, barring his shiny white teeth..Dillon’s hand was so close to the watch.XYFNKWA few more inches and he would have it.XYFNKWChocolate slowly started to emerge from the doghouse.XYFNKWDillon grasped the stick tightly in his hand while he moved his other hand over and grabbed the watch.XYFNKWChocolate’s growl grew more intense.XYFNKWSlowly, Dillon began to stand..Hey boy, he said in a steady tone.XYFNKWHow are you today?XYFNKWChocolate barked..Easy boy, said Dillon with his hand out.XYFNKWYou want the stick?XYFNKWhe asked as he began to wave it.XYFNKWChocolate still growled and issued a bark.XYFNKWDillon waved the stick a little more emphatically.XYFNKWWanna play?XYFNKWCome on boy … come on … he.said in the most playful voice he could muster..Dillon started to back away slowly.XYFNKWHe didn’t think the dog was going for it..He still waved the stick and tried to get Chocolate’s attention with it.XYFNKWThe dog crouched lower and began to stalk in.XYFNKWDillon now knew that he had but one option: run.XYFNKWBefore he was able to turn, Chocolate leaped at him, his canine fangs leading the way.XYFNKWDillon twisted and turned around the nearest tree the dog landed with a thud, tearing at the bark where Dillon was just a moment earlier..The young boy pumped his legs as fast as he could, knowing that the ferocious dog was coming at him without mercy.XYFNKWHe could hear the dog break around the tree in pursuit but he didn’t dare to even turn his head and look.XYFNKWHis only hope, he knew, was to get to the fence..Chocolate tore through the brush like a dog possessed!XYFNKWHe was almost on top.of Dillon when his name rang through the air as a large stick land right near him..Chocolate stopped to take note.XYFNKWOver here Chocolate!XYFNKWyelled Sarah again, standing about fifteen feet from him..Dillon glanced over to see his friend standing there and noted that she had just bought him some time.XYFNKWSarah ran as soon as the dog noticed her.XYFNKWIt was confused for a moment as it stared between the two, as if wondering which one.would make a juicier snack.XYFNKWIt decided to keep going for Dillon as it again turned toward him and resumed the chase..Dillon could see the fence and the others standing safely on the other side..They began to cheer when they saw him and Sarah, then their cheer turned to shrieks of horror as they saw Chocolate in hot pursuit coming through the small.clearing that led to the fence..Dillon knew he was going to be hard-pressed to make it so he turned to meet.the charging dog and got his stick up just in time.XYFNKWChocolate bit down on the branch and began to tear it back and forth.XYFNKWIt was all Dillon could do to keep the stick in his hands.XYFNKWHe knew he had to make a break over the fence, so he let go.of the stick and twisted his body, placing a hand on the fence and leaped.XYFNKWThe.dog tore at the stick a little more then threw it to the ground and lunged toward Dillon.XYFNKWThe boy curled up his legs as Chocolate snapped his huge maw at him..The dog managed to grab some of the fabric on Dillon’s pant leg, but it wasn’t.enough to get a good hold, and it tore free.XYFNKWDillon cleared the fence and landed on the ground with a thud, feeling some of the wind being blown from his lungs..He lay there for a moment, trying to get his breath back.XYFNKWWhen he managed.to look up he saw the faces of his friends staring down at him with huge smiles, cheering, and offering to help him up..Dillon quickly sat up onto his elbows then glance over to Sarah who was just.getting up from where she was kneeling after jumping the fence.XYFNKWChocolate was.barking as ferociously as he could and ramming his head into the fence..That was awesome!XYFNKWyelled Tyler Jones, a scrawny ten year old who always.loved hanging out with Dillon on the playground and being part of his adventures.XYFNKWThe others agreed enthusiastically..Dillon nodded and shook off the loose grass that clung to his clothes.XYFNKWSarah.marched over and punched him in the arm as hard as she could.XYFNKWOw!XYFNKWhe complained.XYFNKWWhat was that for?Oh I think you know!XYFNKWshe replied.XYFNKWYou know … you know … you know!she yelled.XYFNKWThat was the stupidest thing you have ever done!Dillon was quiet, and so were the rest of the kids.XYFNKWIn fact, the silence was so.awkward that the others started to slink away muttering one excuse or another..Sarah’s angry eyes bore into him.XYFNKWFrom his pocket Dillon produced the watch and smiled..Was it worth it?XYFNKWSarah asked, her anger not abated at all.XYFNKWIs that worth your life?XYFNKWshe yelled, pointing an angry finger at the watch..I think you’re exaggerating a little, Dillon responded as he put the watch back in his pocket.XYFNKWAnd yes … I can’t explain it, but this was worth it..Sarah looked at him in disbelief, snorted, and stormed away.XYFNKWBy then.Chocolate had calmed down and slunk back into the tree-line, heading for his doghouse again..Dillon was left there by himself the soft, cool wind brushing against his face.XYFNKWWhy was this so important?XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWAfter a moment more he.merely shrugged the thought away and headed toward the school as he knew the lunch break was about to end....4.D U S T V A L L E Y D E S E R T O A S I S R E S O R T.After a few days, Dillon’s relationship with Sarah was still broken.XYFNKWShe.had refused to hang out the last couple of days, or even talk to him for.that matter.XYFNKWHe had trouble figuring out why she was so angry.XYFNKWHe knew.he had to repair whatever damage had been done, but he didn’t quite know how.to go about it..After school on the third day after the incident in Miss Kettle’s yard, as Dillon walked onto the school bus, he noticed that none of Sarah’s other friends had sat down with her yet.XYFNKWThis is my chance, he thought to himself..As he walked up to her seat he noticed that she was quick to turn her face away from him and stare out the window, pretending not to see him.XYFNKWIs this seat taken?XYFNKWhe asked innocently..She glanced up at him with a blank expression that he found hard to read.XYFNKWI.really need to talk to you, he was quick to add, feeling as though he was on the edge of his chance at any reconciliation.XYFNKWPlease, he pleaded..Fine, she replied in a cold tone..Dillon smiled and sat down.XYFNKWListen, he started, I’m really sorry I upset you the other day.XYFNKWIt was stupid of me and I—.It’s okay, Sarah interrupted him, managing a little smile.XYFNKWYou just get me.so angry sometimes with your crazy ideas..Dillon was shocked!XYFNKWHe didn’t think it would be that easy.XYFNKWWe’re okay then?XYFNKWhe asked..Ya.XYFNKWYou know me.XYFNKWI can’t stay mad at you forever..Dillon smiled.XYFNKWThanks!So what’s so special about that watch anyway?XYFNKWSarah asked..Dillon took it out of his backpack.XYFNKWI don’t know, he replied.XYFNKWThere’s just.something about it.XYFNKWHe opened it up and showed Sarah the inside with the faded.face and the missing hands..She took it and looked it over.XYFNKWIt just looks like a piece of junk, she stated..She looked at the back and noticed the letters JTS.XYFNKWJTS?XYFNKWshe asked.XYFNKWWhat’s that mean?I don’t know.XYFNKWIt could be anything?You said you found this in the forest beside your house?Ya.XYFNKWIn a really weird spot too.XYFNKWI can’t for the life of me think why it was where it was, Dillon stated..Sarah handed the watch back.XYFNKWWell, it is kind of cool finding something that’s that old and worn.XYFNKWShe smiled.XYFNKWYou’ve always been into old stuff..Dillon put the watch back in his pack and smiled at his friend.XYFNKWHe knew that.she would come around..He glanced out the window as he zipped up the bag and noticed his older sister Claire with Jeff Hogan, a tall gangly fourteen year old with light brown shaggy hair.XYFNKWHe wore tattered jeans and a tank top.XYFNKWClaire smiled and laughed at something Jeff had said while putting her hand on his shoulder.XYFNKWShe leaned over.and gave him a kiss before turning and rushing to the bus..As she walked down the aisle Dillon looked up and gave her a quick smirk..What’s that for nerd?XYFNKWshe asked disdainfully..Nothing.XYFNKWCan’t I smile at my sister?Ah … no, she replied as she moved passed him to join some of her friends.who saved her a seat near the back of the bus..Wow.XYFNKWShe’s rude isn’t she?XYFNKWSarah noted..Dillon shrugged, not really caring too much about Claire’s attitude.XYFNKWIt’s just.how she is.XYFNKWBut now I know something that she doesn’t..Oh ya.XYFNKWWhat’s that?She doesn’t know that I know she’s dating Jeff Hogan, he replied with a..smile..Sarah laughed and shook her head, always amused at the interplay that happens between Dillon and his siblings..THAT NIGHT DINNER WAS AWESOME!XYFNKWTHE ROAST CHICKEN WAS PERFECTLY DONE.with the skin at just the right crispiness level!XYFNKWDillon loved roast chicken.XYFNKWAnd those baked potatoes!XYFNKWEven the salad was good which was always a bonus, especially for someone who didn't like eating vegetables that much.XYFNKWThere was even a rumour that Mom had made cheesecake!Mom and Dad always provided for the family, but sometimes the food.selection was limited due to finances.XYFNKWSpecial meals were always made to celebrate special occasions and today’s meal was definitely special, which made.Dillon wonder what was up..So what’s the special occasion?XYFNKWDillon finally asked, as he went in for another helping of that delicious chicken..Nothing much, replied Dad.XYFNKWI just thought I would treat the family tonight..Riiiiight … replied Jordan, Dillon’s older brother, in a skeptical tone..Dad smiled back.XYFNKWOh … and I just wanted everyone to know that we just might be going on a family vacation this year after all..Dillon’s jaw dropped to the floor!How is that possible?XYFNKWasked Claire..Well, it turns out that I won some tickets to Dust Valley Desert Oasis Resort.—the same place Aunt Clarissa, Uncle Gerald, and their kids went a couple years ago—from filling out an on-line survey for a stats-gathering agency.XYFNKWI don’t remember doing the survey, but it was probably done a while ago..Everything's been verified so I know it’s not a scam, Dad explained..That’s great!XYFNKWJordan exclaimed.XYFNKWUncle Gerald said that the place was awesome for hiking, biking, canoeing, and all sorts of other outdoor activities..Don’t forget about the girls, Gwen said in a sly tone..Jordan’s face turned red.XYFNKWOh, shut up!XYFNKWhe snapped back..Jordan!XYFNKWDon’t use that language!XYFNKWMom interjected..Jordan slumped back in his chair, clearly not happy about his little sister’s observation while Claire and Gwen chuckled to themselves..So when are we planning to go?XYFNKWasked Dillon.XYFNKWSummer time is just.around the corner..Really!XYFNKWClaire stated in a snotty tone.XYFNKWWe’re barely halfway through spring and you think Summer is ‘right around the corner,’ she ended as she made the air-quote sign with her fingers..What?XYFNKWDillon shrugged innocently.XYFNKWTo me that is ‘right around the.corner,’ he air-quoted back.XYFNKWIn truth, however, Dillon didn’t know how he was.going to handle the wait.XYFNKWHe was one of the worst ones in the family for having.patience right before a big family trip.XYFNKWHe knew he would have to find something to keep his mind off of it..Dad just shook his head and snickered at his children’s banter.XYFNKWWell, he started, after Dillon and Claire had quieted, the tickets are really specific in regard to the timing.XYFNKWFortunately, my boss already gave me those days off in order for us to take the vacation, Dad explained..And that day is …?XYFNKWClaire prodded..It just happens to be July sixth to the seventeenth..That’s awesome!XYFNKWDillon exclaimed.XYFNKWThat’s right after Independence Day!So we get to enjoy that weekend with our friends and then we’re off for a wicked family vacation!Mom smiled at his exuberant display as she scooped a little bit more salad onto Gwen’s plate.XYFNKWGwen frowned at Mom..Sorry guys, but I need to ask the obvious question.XYFNKWHow are we going to afford the spending money?XYFNKWClaire reasoned..Mom and Dad shared knowing looks and grinned at one another..That’s the best part, Dad said.XYFNKWThe resort is all-inclusive and the tickets come with a two thousand dollar voucher that can be used for any activities or.merchandise on the property..What!XYFNKWJordan yelled, not able to contain his excitement.XYFNKWIt sounds too..good to be true..Always the skeptic, Mom said, as she gave Jordan that motherly look which reproved the kids from time to time..Well I think it’s awesome!XYFNKWGwen responded with a massive grin..It is awesome, Dad replied.XYFNKWAnd much needed for our family..With that, the Hunt family continued to chatter away about the prospects for.fun and relaxation that this vacation was going to bring for their family..Dillon’s mind was transported far away as he began to imagine the great adventures he was about to have at the Dust Valley Desert Oasis Resort.XYFNKWIt was.going to be a time to remember.XYFNKWMore so than he even realized..DILLON LOOKED AT THE WATCH.XYFNKWHE HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND.XYFNKWEVERYTHING.around him was dark.XYFNKWThe only thing he could see was the watch.XYFNKWIt had a single.hand attached to it which was spinning clockwise.XYFNKWIt spun and spun and spun—.faster and faster and faster.XYFNKWHe began to get mesmerized by the spinning action.when suddenly he was ripped from his daze by a loud hiss..He whipped around and lurched backwards as a large snake head lunged.toward him, fangs bared.XYFNKWHe stumbled and threw his hands up as the thing came.in..Dillon opened his eyes, gasping for breath!XYFNKWHe looked at the ceiling of his bedroom and saw the lights from the street dancing there that reflected through.the prism that hung by his window..He sat up, turned on the night light that was on his night stand, and grabbed.the watch that sat there.XYFNKWHe opened it up and noted that there still weren’t any hands attached to it..That was weird, Dillon commented to himself as he closed up the watch and laid back down.XYFNKWThe dream seemed so real to him.XYFNKWHe had real-seeming dreams before, but for some reason he felt that this was different.XYFNKWHe just didn’t know why..He turned the light off, laid down again, and closed his eyes hoping this.time that he would have more pleasant dreams....5.J O H N T A Y L O R S E B A S T I A N.Dillon flew down the track, dust being kicked up by the bikes in front.of him.XYFNKWHe drifted around the corner and noticed that he was catching.up with the leaders.XYFNKWThis was the last bike race of the year, and he promised himself that he would finish in the top three.XYFNKWEven though his parents.couldn’t afford the nicer bikes that most of the others used, he was still able to keep pace with them through his shear determination and skill..BMX racing had been a big part of his life for the last four years, and he loved it.XYFNKWHe loved the adrenalin, the speed, and the air he was able to get when going over the jumps..He could hear his Mom screaming for him to go as he soared through the air..He landed and pumped his legs furiously, desperately trying to overtake the biker who was in third position.XYFNKWThey were so close together.XYFNKWDillon could feel his legs burning with every thrust down on the pedals..He and the other biker raced around the last corner leading to the home stretch.XYFNKWThey could see the bikers who were in first and second place they were only a few feet ahead of them and there were only two more jumps and a short.straight until the end..They came over the first jump and Dillon managed to land in third place and.was within striking distance of second, maybe even first.XYFNKWHe pumped harder and.harder.XYFNKWThey went up the last jump.XYFNKWDillon could see the finish line.XYFNKWAll four of them were so close as they soared through the air they could almost touch each..other if they just reached out.XYFNKWWhen he came down his landing was off.XYFNKWHe hit.the track hard and his front tire lost its traction and slid out from under him.XYFNKWAs the others sped toward the finish line Dillon was thrown from his bike and slammed hard onto the dirt track.XYFNKWThe momentum carried him for a few feet as.he rolled and slid to a halt.XYFNKWThere was a collective sound of shock that came from the crowd as he hit the ground.XYFNKWHe could hear his Mom shriek..He coughed and wheezed as he tried to get some air back into his lungs.XYFNKWAs.he got to his knees he saw other bikers landing the jump and whipping past him..A few of them landed so close that he thought they were going to crash into him, but luckily that didn’t happen..After what seemed a long moment he climbed to his feet and the crowd erupted into cheers.XYFNKWHe could see the medical staff running toward him but tried to wave them off.XYFNKWHe knew they weren’t going to stop so, before they could get.to him, he picked up his bike, mounted it, and road to the line.XYFNKWAs he crossed over and finished the race he didn’t feel so bad anymore about coming in dead.last..THE WEEK AND A HALF AFTER THE END OF SCHOOL WAS PRETTY UNEVENTFUL.XYFNKWHE.hung out with Sarah a few times and their other friend on the street, Evan.XYFNKWThey had some pretty decent times together, but what all of them were really interested in was the trip his family was taking to Dust Valley Desert Oasis Resort..Look here!XYFNKWSarah exclaimed, as she pointed to the computer screen..Dillon, their friend Evan, and her were all hunched over the table staring intently at the screen.XYFNKWThey had decided that it would be cool to do some research on Dust Valley Desert Oasis Resort since it wasn’t a really well known.attraction yet.XYFNKWUnfortunately, it was too expensive for the family budget to have ever allowed them to go that is, until Dad won the trip..It looks like this is an awesome place for trail riding, swimming, and they.have a ton of other cool activities, said Sarah, trying to keep her voice down as.she certainly didn’t want to call down the wrath of the librarian upon them..Ya, that is cool, replied Dillon.XYFNKWI also found, on the site that I was looking at earlier, that the resort is in the middle of the desert, but where it is, is nestled by a lush lake with palm trees, lots of green grass, and all sorts of vegetation.XYFNKWNo one knows how this is possible, but there are many theories behind the mystery..Sarah glanced at her friend with interest, silently prodding him to go on..Evan perked up as well as soon as Dillon mentioned mysteries..Well, Dillon started after clearing his throat.XYFNKWSome believe that there was.a magic spell put on the place by some sort of creature that helped a lost Indian tribe: the Tokala tribe.XYFNKWThey say that the tribe was forced into the desert by a band of US soldiers back in the 1800’s.XYFNKWThe survivors narrowly escaped being killed and found this valley.XYFNKWThey were all but about to die of thirst when suddenly they saw a being show up whose robes were so white that they appeared to glow.XYFNKWWhatever it was shook the earth and water began to come up.from below.XYFNKWSoon after, vegetation began to grow and the place revitalized..Apparently many geologists have searched around for an entrance to an.underground spring, but no one has found it except maybe one..Dillon paused in his story telling for effect until Sarah finally burst out,.Who!He smiled before beginning his tale again.XYFNKWI say maybe because there, apparently, was a famed and wealthy archeologist named John Taylor Sebastian.who, in 2016 thoroughly explored the grounds.XYFNKWWhen he was about to give up it.was reported that he disappeared, but no one saw him leave the area..Sarah gasped.XYFNKWEvan’s mouth hung open..That’s way more interesting than the site I found, she replied..Ya, the news report I found said that his car and all the belongings were discovered at the place he was renting, he continued.XYFNKWThere was a cryptic note stating that he had found something significant, but there were no details as to where he was going.XYFNKWHis field pack with his equipment was also missing..Presumably, he took it with him to wherever he was going..What did the note say exactly?XYFNKWSarah asked..I don’t know, as there was no information about it from the sources I.checked because no one knows where the note went.XYFNKWSome even doubt if it actually really existed..The three of them sat in silence for a moment, trying to digest the creepy story..Finally Evan asked, So if John Taylor Sebastian actually found the entrance.to the source of whatever is causing the Oasis to thrive, then that means he most likely died on his quest?All Dillon could do was nod slightly at Evan’s logic..Cool!XYFNKWEvan exclaimed in amazement.XYFNKWSarah punched him in the arm and scowled..Dillon laughed.XYFNKWI think the whole tale about the tribe fleeing for their lives, and the mysterious supernatural event that saved them was probably just made up.XYFNKWI checked other sources which suspect that the Oasis is only about five years old or so.XYFNKWAt least that’s when the resort opened.XYFNKWThe story was probably fabricated in order to bring more visitors.XYFNKWIt’s pretty good marketing if you ask me..Then what about John Taylor Sebastian?XYFNKWEvan asked.XYFNKWIs that true?Dillon looked at them both, suddenly serious again.XYFNKWActually, that part is true.XYFNKWAnd the part about the other scientists trying to find the source of what gives the Oasis life is true too.XYFNKWThere has been no record of this place existing until about five years ago as I said.XYFNKWThis naturally piqued the curiosity of the scientific community who have had limited excursions, but nothing significant,.as I said, has been found..What do you mean by limited?XYFNKWEvan asked as he was really getting drawn into the story now..Well the place is actually private property, Dillon replied.XYFNKWIt’s owned by the Tokala Indian tribe—the same tribe from the story—who has allowed access.to the premises to certain researchers, but they have not given complete permission to do what they want.XYFNKWThe band also claims not to know how the Oasis began, which is why they let scientists come and investigate.XYFNKWThey are probably interested in finding out why the Oasis is thriving so well..That makes sense, Sarah interjected.XYFNKWThey do have a business to run after.all.XYFNKWAnd, even though they are probably curious, too much snooping around might disrupt things for them..She looked at Dillon right in the eyes.XYFNKWYou have to promise me that you won’t do anything stupid like going to look for this entrance, Sarah stated sternly..Dillon laughed again.XYFNKWIf most people—scientists—spend months or a couple.of years trying to find this secret source, then how do you think I’ll find it in two weeks?I don’t know, Sarah responded as she sat back trying to digest the story..But you tend to find things that others don’t.XYFNKWIt’s actually kind of creepy..Dillon smiled, trying to reassure her without actually saying anything.because, truth be told, he does end up stumbling upon things that others don’t..It’s really not his fault he thought to himself..Despite what the origin of the Oasis was, the one fact remained: no one has.ever found out when and where it came from.XYFNKWNo one except maybe this John guy, and he’s been missing for a while now....6.T H E A R R O W H E A D.Dillon’s hand reached toward the symbol that was etched into the cold.stone wall.XYFNKWHis fingers quivered slightly as he rubbed them across the.carving.XYFNKWThere was writing surrounding the image on the wall, but he.couldn’t make out the language.XYFNKWThe image was a pentagram boxed in by a square, and in the center of the pentagram was what appeared to be an eye..Dillon felt a chill as a blast of wind came down the tunnel, causing the flame.on his torch to waver a little.XYFNKWHe would have used the light on his phone, but the battery died out a few minutes earlier, which was weird given the fact that it should have lasted longer than that as he had a fresh charge..He felt a slight tug on the arm of his shirt.XYFNKWWhen he glanced over he saw his.sister, Gwen, standing beside him her eyes showing that she was distressed.XYFNKWI.want to get out of here, she said to him in a soft tone, a tear trickling down her cheek..We will Gwen, Dillon replied.XYFNKWTruthfully, however, he wasn’t sure how he.would be able to get them out.XYFNKWBut he couldn't let his sister know his doubts..Whatever it took, he knew he would have to do what he could to keep them alive..As they stood there looking at the carving on the wall, trying to make sense.of it, they both heard the sound of something coming from down the tunnel..They jerked their heads around, Dillon waved the torch in front of him so he could get as much light as he could.XYFNKWFrom the shadows he saw movement.coming toward them.XYFNKWGwen tightened her grip on her brother’s arm.XYFNKWDillon reflexively went for a weapon, but quickly realized that the only thing he had that would help was the torch..Suddenly something jumped from the shadows.XYFNKWIt hurled its bulbous body toward them.XYFNKWGwen shrieked.XYFNKWDillon pushed his sister aside and the creature sailed between them.XYFNKWDillon slammed into the side of the tunnel opposite Gwen..He looked to where the creature had landed and, as the light of the torch touched the area, he noticed a large spider-like thing quickly spinning around.XYFNKWIt was about the size of a soccer ball, had grotesque pincers protruding out of its maw, and a large hairy bulbous body.XYFNKWIt had two massive lidless eyes and made a strange clicking sound as it moved its head side-to-side.XYFNKWIt flinched and shied away from Dillon as though its eyes were incredibly sensitive to the light..Gwen yelped again as she saw the creature in the full brightness of the torch..Immediately, despite the torchlight, it seemed to hone in on her and pounced..Dillon launched forward and swatted it out of the air with the torch.XYFNKWIt made a screech as it hit the wall hard and slumped to the ground.XYFNKWIts many legs flailed wildly as it tried to right itself.XYFNKWGwen leaped away as Dillon went in and hit it again and again and again until it stopped moving..Wha … What is that?XYFNKWGwen asked, wiping away tears from her eyes..I don’t know, replied Dillon as he poked at it with his foot.XYFNKWBut let’s not.wait around to find out.XYFNKWWith that, he grabbed Gwen by the arm and started off.down the tunnel the opposite way the creature had come.XYFNKWAs soon as they started.off, they could hear more movement coming toward them, lots of movement..And that clicking!XYFNKWGwen tried hard to suppress her fear but couldn’t.XYFNKWThere’s more coming!XYFNKWshe screamed..Dillon pulled his sister down the passage as fast as he could.XYFNKWThe sound of the monster’s many legs was getting louder as the creatures were closing in, and the clicking they made was terrifying.XYFNKWAs Dillon and Gwen ran they could hear.the sound of running water coming from up ahead.XYFNKWThe tunnel dipped and turned, obviously not being man made, but rather formed by some natural process from long ago.XYFNKWThe sound of the water was getting louder, almost drowning out the sound of the creature’s advance.XYFNKWThey rounded another corner..and the tunnel opened into a large cavern.XYFNKWThey found themselves on a wide ledge that was about ten feet long and ended in a shear drop into darkness.XYFNKWThe.cavern was dimly lit its walls sparkling as though the two were looking at the.night sky except that the sky was all around them..Dillon didn’t have time to enjoy the scenery, however, as the bulbous beasts.came charging around the corner.XYFNKWDillon and Gwen backed toward the ledge as.Dillon held his torch as high as he could out in front of him as far as he could, trying to illuminate as much area as possible.XYFNKWThe first creatures who came out.of the tunnel immediately flinched and slowed as the light hit their eyes.XYFNKWThey still seemed interested in the pursuit, but moved cautiously as the brightness of the torch stung their eyes..One of the creatures leaped at them, but Dillon was quick to knock it out of.the way with the torch.XYFNKWSparks flew as he made contact with it and it issued a horrifying shriek as it tumbled from the ledge and into the dark below..Gwen wept as the others, about ten in number now, slowly approached,.pincers snapping.XYFNKWGet away from us!XYFNKWGwen shouted, picking up a nearby rock.and tossing it at the nearest monster.XYFNKWShe hit it in the eye and it shrieked as it backed a little..What are we gonna do Dillon?XYFNKWasked an agitated Gwen..There’s only one thing we can do Gwen, replied Dillon in as even a tone as.he could muster.XYFNKWHe looked down at his sister, picked her up in his arms, and leaped from the ledge..DILLON!XYFNKWDILLON!XYFNKWGWEN NUDGED HER BROTHER..Dillon moved his head slightly, his eyes fluttering open.XYFNKWStaring at him were.the bright eyes and beaming smile of his little sister.XYFNKWHe looked around groggily and realized he was in the back of the Hunt family van as they were travelling to Dust Valley Desert Oasis Resort..Wow, that was a crazy dream, he whispered to himself..It must have been!XYFNKWGwen exclaimed.XYFNKWYou were moving around pretty.good.XYFNKWAnd mumbling stuff..Oh yeah … like what?XYFNKWDillon asked, a look of curiosity splayed across his.face..I don’t know exactly, Gwen stated.XYFNKWIt was kinda hard to make out.XYFNKWI think.it had something to do with spiders.XYFNKWI thought you were going to wake up screaming actually..Dillon looked at her seriously for a moment and then smiled his usual disarming smile.XYFNKWWell it’s a good thing that didn’t happen..Gwen giggled..The car trip to Dust Valley Desert Oasis Resort was about eight hours from.home and, as far as car trips went, it was pretty standard for the Hunt family, except for Dillon’s dream.XYFNKWHis imagination was always exceptionally active, but.when he went to bed he didn’t normally have such intense dreams.XYFNKWHe thought.that maybe it was all the excitement and anticipation waiting for the family vacation..Jordan, as always, had his face stuck in a game of some sort whether it was.DS, phone, tablet, or the like.XYFNKWThe only sounds you would get out of him were.the sounds of victory (Yeah!!!!XYFNKWI told you, you were going down!), or defeat (Ahhhhh!XYFNKW… What the …!XYFNKW… Oh come on!).XYFNKWAfter Dillon woke up Gwen would notice him marking down something in his book every time Jordan made.one of his outbursts..What are you doing?XYFNKWshe leaned over and whispered..It’s a social experiment, he replied.XYFNKWI’m marking down how many times.he loses verses how many times he wins..She smiled and nodded.XYFNKWHow’s he doing?Not very good I’m afraid..Gwen giggled and then went back to playing one of her games on her tablet..Claire had her face securely planted in her phone, making sure she was able.to keep up on the latest drama with her friends.XYFNKWAfter all, she was fourteen and, it was rumoured, that the world would stop spinning if she missed something that.happened on social media!XYFNKWOnce in a while she would grimace and complain when the van hit a dead spot in the cell service, and then resumed again when.the service came back..Dillon, however, continued to read the information he had found on Dust Valley Desert Oasis Resort.XYFNKWAs the van continued to roll along down the highway.on their lengthy trip, Dillon noticed a distinctive change in the scenery which caught his attention.XYFNKWThe landscape went from lush green forests and mountain scenes, to flat arid land.XYFNKWHe started to notice areas with large plateaus high in the sky, shrub brush, even small canyons.XYFNKWHe saw a variety of different wildlife: antelope, large birds of prey, and even a few wild horses.XYFNKWThe sky was vast, strikingly blue, and lit up with bright sunshine.XYFNKWAs they drove further to their goal the ground turned to a baked reddish-yellowish color..A couple of hours after their last rest break the van began to slow again as Dad decided that it was prudent to make another quick stop for a restroom break.at one of the Exxon stations.XYFNKWApparently he also needed more coffee in his system as well.XYFNKWMom, as always, reiterated about ten times the need for all of the kids to go to the restroom as there may not be another stop for a while.XYFNKWAs per.usual, Jordan complained that he had to get off of his gaming system..You know, Jordan, Dad said, there is a pause button on your system for a.reason.XYFNKWJordan mumbled something incoherent and put his game down..As Dillon jumped out of the car the heat hit him!XYFNKWIt felt like he had just opened the oven to check on the chocolate chip cookies!XYFNKWMan, he thought to himself, I didn’t realize it was going to be this hot!The restroom was one of those outdoor ones where you had to get the key from the attendant inside the station.XYFNKWAs per usual Jordan managed to get the key before Dillon could and occupied the restroom first.XYFNKWAs Dillon waited outside he noted the nice scenery of trees and brush that was around the gas station.XYFNKWThe station was nestled up beside a hill that was filled with the hardy desert shrubs..The wind blew slightly, but there was no way it was going to lessen the heat.XYFNKWIn fact, the wind made it seem hotter!XYFNKWNot refreshing at all..As Dillon was waiting for Jordon to finish he saw something move out of the.corner of his eye.XYFNKWHe turned to see a small prairie dog standing on the pavement just outside the tree-line looking at him.XYFNKWDillon smiled.XYFNKWHere boy, he said as he stooped down, trying not to appear intimidating.XYFNKWThe prairie dog looked around a..bit, came toward him a few feet and then darted back into the forest when the restroom door swung open..Jordan looked down at his brother.XYFNKWWhat are you doing?XYFNKWhe asked..Dillon stood.XYFNKWNothing, he replied.XYFNKWJust trying to make a friend..Jordan laughed.XYFNKWIt’s all yours, he said motioning to the restroom.XYFNKWI’ll see.you back at the car bro..Dillon nodded.XYFNKWWhen he came out a couple of minutes later he glanced over.to where the prairie dog was, just to see if his little friend was there.XYFNKWIt was gone, but a small glint caught his eye.XYFNKWHe walked over and, on the ground roughly where the squirrel had been, was a small steel arrow head.XYFNKWIt was plain looking.except that the middle portion of it, on one side, had three bumps formed there, almost like nubs, and there was a tiny hole in the middle that was barely noticeable.XYFNKWThe nub nearest the point was positioned almost in the middle of the head, the next one was in the middle off to one side, and the one positioned near the end of the head was off to the other side..Come on Dillon, he heard his Dad holler..The call was enough to pull him from his thoughts.XYFNKWHe quickly scooped up.the arrow head and rushed back to the van..As soon as Dillon was buckled in he started examining his find.XYFNKWAside from.the other features he already noted when he first looked at the item, he also noticed that there was a small hole drilled through the middle of it.XYFNKWThat’s weird, he thought to himself..Whatcha got there?XYFNKWGwen asked as she noticed that Dillon was handling something..Oh nothing, Dillon responded.XYFNKWJust something I found at the gas station..He said it like it was no big deal, but deep down inside he had that same strange feeling that he had with the watch.XYFNKWHe felt this arrowhead was important somehow, but he didn’t know why.XYFNKWThis feeling was irrational but he knew it was somehow right.XYFNKWIt was actually starting to frighten him..DEREK WATCHED THE YOUNG BOY RUN TO THE VAN AS HE CONTINUED TO FUEL UP.his car.XYFNKWHe noted how Dillon had come out of the restroom and then observed,.with surprise, as something caught the boys attention.XYFNKWHe found the arrow head I just placed there!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWHe was amazed at the power of Dillon’s apparent observational skills.XYFNKWIt was quite impressive.XYFNKWThere had to be some sort of inherent ability to observe changes in his surroundings which displayed itself in finding things that others might miss, he reasoned to himself.XYFNKWAlthough, he thought, it wouldn’t be the first time he had seen something weird that couldn’t be explained by any science that they knew of..He finished filling up his tank, grabbed the receipt off the pump, and climbed.back in his car.XYFNKWJake was sitting in the passenger seat this time..Do you think it wise to be giving these items to the boy?XYFNKWDerek asked..Jake merely shrugged.XYFNKWI’m sure we could get them back some way or other.if we had to.XYFNKWBesides, we’re running out of options and we need someone who.will be able to find the entrance for us..It is pretty desperate to leave our fortunes in the hands of a twelve year old.boy, Derek reasoned..We are desperate!XYFNKWJake snapped back.XYFNKWAfter he calmed himself he said,.It’s been a while since we have had any breaks in this case and, with the changes in Dillon’s grandfather, we had to go with Dillon..Why not his Dad or any of his other siblings?XYFNKWasked Derek..Jake shook his head.XYFNKWNo, we observed his Dad and he just doesn’t seem to.have the gift.XYFNKWHis brother and older sister are a lot different than Dillon and don’t exhibit any of the traits of their grandfather either..And what about his younger sister?XYFNKWDerek asked with intrigue..Jake paused for a moment before he spoke, almost as if to collect his thoughts.XYFNKWEven if his younger sister does exhibit the same kind of qualities she’s too young to help us out with this particular exhibition, he said at length..And a twelve year old boy isn’t?XYFNKWDerek asked skeptically..All he got in return from Jake was a slight smirk as he turned the ignition in.the car and pulled away from the gas station as they continued to head for Dust.Valley Desert Oasis Resort....7.T H E I N F O R M A T I O N C E N T E R.The Hunt family van rolled smoothly through the hills and valleys of.the desolate desert.XYFNKWCacti were scattered throughout the landscape, and.vultures could be seen high up in the sky circling the terrain, waiting.to pounce upon any of the small creatures they could see (living or dead) that were sprinkled throughout the arid land..Jordan, Claire, and Gwen were all sleeping by this time as they were pretty.worn out by the long drive and the monotonous view.XYFNKWDillon, however, stared intently out the window imagining some grand adventure where he was being chased by creatures that have been hidden for years amongst the many caves and.valleys that made the rocky desert interesting.XYFNKWThis would be an awesome spot to explore!XYFNKWhe thought to himself..Hey Dad.XYFNKWI don’t suppose there are any rest stops coming up where we can.get out at and take a look around?XYFNKWhe asked..Unfortunately not, Dad replied.XYFNKWBesides, we are actually almost there..Dillon looked out the window skeptically.XYFNKWOkay, he replied dejectedly..Don’t be like that, Mom reprimanded gently.XYFNKWThere are going to be tons.of places for you to explore when we get to the resort.XYFNKWIt won’t be long now ….probably within the hour, she stated..About twenty minutes later Dillon felt the van slowing.XYFNKWHe looked out the front window and noticed that dad seemed to be pulling over to an information.center.XYFNKWHe looked at Dillon in the rear view mirror and smirked.XYFNKWMaybe we can.afford a quick stop..Awesome!XYFNKWresponded Dillon..But we’re not exploring, Dad was quick to add.XYFNKWWe’re just here to see if.there’s more information on the place than what they already sent to us..Sounds good to me, Dillon replied, sitting up all the straighter now and acting as though new energy had been injected into him..The other kids woke up as soon as the van was pulling into the parking lot..The only one who didn’t seem interested in checking out the info center was Claire.XYFNKWShe just seemed more interested in staying with the van and chilling.but Dad made her get out anyway and go inside with them.XYFNKWThere was no way he.was going to leave the van on in order to keep the AC running, and he couldn’t.leave her in a vehicle by herself in this desert heat..Dillon and Gwen were the first to burst through the doors.XYFNKWAs they did they.were immediately struck with the sound of multiple chimes at different pitches going off in a musical pattern that sounded almost harp-like.XYFNKWThey both stopped.and looked for the source.XYFNKWThere, at the top of the door were hand-crafted wooden pipes which were strung together with thin pieces of cord weaved through each pipe at different intervals.XYFNKWHanging from the pipes were small hammers that moved and struck the strings as the door swung the chime freely.when it was opened.XYFNKWThe pipes also had holes of different sizes in them which whistled as they moved and air passed through them..Cool!XYFNKWDillon and Gwen both exclaimed at the same time..The main room was circular with lots of different kinds of stuffed critters that were native to the area mounted on the walls and some standing on pedestals.XYFNKWGwen was in awe.XYFNKWShe looked around the large room and tried to take.it all in.XYFNKWAs she turned her head she jumped back and yelped as her face was inches from a grizzly looking stuffed coyote that was barring its fangs.XYFNKWDad chuckled and put his arm around her when he came through the door.XYFNKWDillon, Jordan, and Mom were already checking out the rest of the info center..It’s okay honey, he said reassuringly.XYFNKWIt’s just a stuffed animal, like the ones you have at home..Slowly she reached over and touched the thing on the nose.XYFNKWIt felt warm.XYFNKWShe.quickly pulled her hand away and stared at it in the eyes.XYFNKWIt’s eyes look so real,.Gwen said as she further inspected the creature..Some say that you can feel old Charlie here bore through your soul when he.looks at you, came a deep voice from the side.XYFNKWDad and Gwen both looked over.to see an older native man, with long jet black hair that was streaked with silver..His face was wrinkled and weathered from years of living under the hot desert.sun.XYFNKWHe wore tattered jeans, a plain baby blue t-shirt, and a worn leather vest..His brown combat boots made a distinctive clunking sound as he strolled across.the wooden floor toward the Hunts..But I personally think those people are crazy, he finished with a slight chuckle.XYFNKWThe name’s Tom Tom, he said to dad as he held out his hand..Dad took his hand and gave him a firm shake.XYFNKWI’m Bruce Hunt and this is.my daughter Gwen..Tom Tom looked down at the little girl and smiled.XYFNKWMy friends call me Old.Tom Tom, he said as he stooped down and held out his hand to Gwen.XYFNKWShe shied away, being a little unnerved by the stranger..Go on Gwen, Dad prodded.XYFNKWThere’s nothing to be afraid of..She hesitantly stuck her hand out and shook his lightly..Now that’s better, he said, standing up again.XYFNKWWhat brings you folks here?We’re just on our way to the resort, Dad replied.XYFNKWI imagine that most of.the people you see around here are on their way there..Tom Tom nodded..Is there anything I can get you in particular?XYFNKWhe asked..No, Dad said.XYFNKWI think we’re just looking around..Well, if you need anything just give me a shout, Tom Tom said as he walked back over to the counter..Gwen, Mom, and Claire headed over to the toys and activity area, while dad.and Jordan wandered around the clothing area.XYFNKWDillon found himself drawn to where they had the books.XYFNKWThere were lots of interesting books on the local area..Some of the books had maps to places of interest, and there were brochures advertising many of the surrounding area activities..As Dillon scanned the rack one book in particular caught his attention.XYFNKWIt was a book on the archeologist John Taylor Sebastian!No way!XYFNKWexclaimed Dillon to himself.XYFNKWHe thumbed through the pages and.read a sentence here and there.XYFNKWThen he flipped the book over to read the back..There was a picture of John Taylor Sebastian himself in the top corner.XYFNKWHe was a middle-aged man—when this picture was taken at least—with light brown.greying hair with a medium build.XYFNKWHe wore a distinctive hat that appeared to be.an Australian oilskin cowboy hat.XYFNKWHe kind of resembled that archeologist from those popular movies that started in the 80’s that Mom and Dad always spoke about: Indiana Jones.XYFNKWThe rest of his clothes appeared to be general everyday wear for outdoor activities: jeans, t-shirt, and hiking boots..The back of the book read:.John Taylor Sebastian, an archeologist and philanthropist a man with a dream and the passion to pursue it!XYFNKWHe was a real life modern-day adventurer with his love of ancient mysteries and exciting lore..His most remembered project was his search for the source of the Desert Oasis Resort’s underground springs which many think brought the area to life..This book is exhilarating and full of information as to his search and eventual failure..To this day, no one knows what exactly happened to John Taylor Sebastian and many rumors have been put forth to explain his strange and sudden.disappearance, but none of these have ever been verified..IT LOOKS LIKE YOU FOUND A GREAT READ, A DEEP VOICE SAID FROM BESIDE.Dillon..Dillon jumped and almost dropped the book.XYFNKWHe looked over to see Tom Tom standing beside him..Man, for a big guy, you’re pretty stealthy, Dillon said as he collected himself..Tom Tom offered a smile.XYFNKWYou interested in that stuff kid?XYFNKWTom Tom asked..Well … sort of, he responded.XYFNKWI mean … I have a thing for exploring new.places and I’ve read a little bit about this guy.XYFNKWHe pointed to the picture on the back of the book.XYFNKWIt’s weird though, he continued, there’s not a lot of information of him on-line.XYFNKWI mean … one would think that a man with his reputation would be more well-known than he is..Ya, you would think so wouldn’t you, said Tom Tom.XYFNKWMaybe someone.doesn’t want people to know about him?XYFNKWhe asked with a quizzical look..Dillon glanced at him questioningly.XYFNKWWhat do you mean?XYFNKWhe asked..Oh nothing.XYFNKWJust the crazy ramblings of an old guy, he said with a chuckle..If you like that book, you should get this one too.XYFNKWHe reached onto another part of the rack and grabbed a smaller book with the title: Creatures of the Desert..Dillon took the book in his hands and looked it over.XYFNKWIt definitely piqued his.curiosity.XYFNKWWhy would you think that I’d be interested in this?XYFNKWhe asked as he.looked up at Tom Tom..Oh … I don’t know, Tom Tom replied.XYFNKWIt just looks like the kind of thing.a kid like you would enjoy.XYFNKWAren’t there always interesting creatures in adventures?XYFNKWWith that, he turned and headed for the front counter once more..Dillon flipped through the two books for a bit more and then rummaged through the rest of the rack nothing else interested him.XYFNKWHe had a strange feeling in his gut that these books would be a little more than interesting.XYFNKWHe couldn’t explain why he felt that way.XYFNKWIt was the same kind of sense he got when he found the watch and arrow head.XYFNKWFinally, Dad called to him which jolted him from his.thoughts, and said that they were leaving..Just a minute Dad, Dillon called back.XYFNKWHe hurried to the counter and placed the books in front of Tom Tom..Is that everything?XYFNKWTom Tom asked..I don’t know, Dillon responded.XYFNKWYou seem to know what I might be.interested in.XYFNKWAny ideas?Tom Tom looked at Dillon for a moment then smiled.XYFNKWI can’t think of anything right now, but we’re only a few miles from the resort if you realize that you need something..Sounds good to me.XYFNKWDillon laid his money on the counter, received his change, and headed for the van.XYFNKWAs he turned to go he noticed something out of.the corner of his eye.XYFNKWHe thought he saw, what looked like, the square surrounding a pentagram, with an eye in the center symbol that he had seen in his dream earlier that day.XYFNKWWhen he snapped his head around to look he didn’t see anything that looked like that.XYFNKWHe scanned the area for a moment, but nothing.XYFNKWNothing but that gut feel again..Everything okay?XYFNKWasked Tom Tom in his deep voice..Ya … I just thought I saw ….Saw what?XYFNKWTom Tom pressed..Dillon gave himself a shake.XYFNKWThe long drive must be messing with my brain..Oh, nothing, he replied, turning away from Tom Tom..Dillon!XYFNKWCome on!XYFNKWDad hollered as he came back into the info center..Coming!Dillon looked back and saw Tom Tom watching them as they left.XYFNKWHe had a.strange feeling that he’d be seeing the old man again he just didn’t know why....8.T H E M Y S T E R I O U S S Y M B O L.As soon as the Hunts came over the hill that led to the mouth of the.valley they could see green grass for miles in all directions.XYFNKWThere were.tropical palm trees speckled throughout the valley, with beds of grass,.lush bushes, and groves of umbrella trees.XYFNKWThere were lots of creeks and ponds.of water throughout the valley, and at the far end of the valley they could see the bright blue water of the lake shimmering in the sunlight.XYFNKWRight in the middle of the valley lay the resort with its numerous buildings, hotels, swimming pools, and lounge areas.XYFNKWThe resort backed right onto the lake that Dillon had read about.XYFNKWOn the outskirts of the resort village were a number of residential properties, convenience stores, and gas stations..The information I’ve read says that there’s actually a small residential population here which is made up of the tribe members who own the land,.Dillon said as they continued down the highway toward the main entrance to the.resort..Apparently there are laws in place which prevent residential development from those outside the tribe.XYFNKWSo most of the people who are here at any given time are tourists, or outside people they’ve brought in to help work at Desert Oasis..It says here in the pamphlet that, before the resort was built five years ago,.there was an intense struggle for the rights of the land but, in the end, the courts ruled in favor of the small band of natives known as the Takala tribe, Dillon.explained.XYFNKWAfter that, they petitioned lawmakers to enact laws around the restriction of buying and selling land in the resort area.XYFNKWBecause of these laws the only full-time residents of the area were descendants of the original Takala tribe..They were the ones who built, own, and run the resort..That’s really interesting, said a sarcastic Jordan.XYFNKWLame!XYFNKWAs if we were interested in that!XYFNKWhe exclaimed..Not everyone in life focuses on video games and girls, Claire put in, which.earned her a death look from her brother.XYFNKWDillon looked at her in surprise.XYFNKWIt wasn’t usually like Claire to stick up for him when Jordan was giving him the gears.XYFNKWShe just smiled back as if to say she was only doing it because of the opportunity it gave her to bug her older brother..Well I find it interesting, replied Mom, the eternal encourager..Jordan rolled his eyes.XYFNKWYou think everything we say is ‘interesting,’ he muttered..What was that, Jordan?XYFNKWhis Dad asked, a warning look in his eyes..Nothing, Dad, Jordan said, slinking lower in his seat..The van rolled up to the front gate where they were greeted by an attendant.wearing a really flashy Hawaiian shirt, kakis shorts, and flip flop sandals.XYFNKWHe was a younger native man, appearing to be in his early twenties, with medium length jet black hair, and an infectious smile..Welcome!XYFNKWhe said enthusiastically.XYFNKWI’m Troy.XYFNKWThe gate keeper.XYFNKWHe said that last bit about being the gate keeper in a lower voice, trying to sound dramatic, then smiled..Dad was taken back a little bit by his enthusiasm.XYFNKWWell, Troy the gate keeper.XYFNKWI’m Bruce Hunt and we have a reservation.XYFNKWDad handed him the reservation papers..Excellent!XYFNKWTroy exclaimed.XYFNKWYou guy’s are going to have an awesome.time.XYFNKWHe looked further into the Van as he scanned the papers..Let me guess … You are obviously the lovely Lilly Hunt, he said looking.to Mom who smiled back.XYFNKWAnd you, my man must be Dillon.XYFNKWAnd beside you.has got to be your sister Gwen.XYFNKWGwen giggled.XYFNKWLooking way in the back of the.van he noted the last of the Hunt kids.XYFNKWAh ha!XYFNKWYou must be Claire.XYFNKWClaire.blushed.XYFNKWAnd the eldest Hunt kid, he said in a sophisticated, terrible British accent, Jordan.XYFNKWJordan nodded, not sure what to make of this weird guy..Wow!XYFNKWGwen explained.XYFNKWHow did you know who we are?Troy smiled It’s as I said.XYFNKWI’m the gate keeper, he said again in his low voice.XYFNKWAnd … this reservation has your names and ages on it..Dad laughed.XYFNKWThanks Troy..No problem.XYFNKWNow, if you just follow this road here down to the end you will.come smack dab into the resort hotel.XYFNKWFrom there they will be able to give you.any of the information you require.XYFNKWI hope you guys have a fantabulous time!As the van pulled away Troy yelled after them, See ya soon Hunt family!Well, he was certainly an enthusiastic guy, Mom noted..Enthusiastic?XYFNKWThat’s an understatement!XYFNKWJordan replied..I thought he was awesome!XYFNKWGwen put in..Dillon looked back out the window as Troy went about doing whatever is was that he did as the gate keeper..He was a pretty cool guy, Dillon thought to himself..The van pulled up to the front of the massive hotel.XYFNKWThe family looked up in.amazement at its size.XYFNKWThey also noted tons of people milling around, walking down the paths, and some sharing a coffee or a drink at one of the nearby tables..As they got out they noted that the weather was just as beautiful as the surroundings.XYFNKWIt seemed cooler in the valley at the resort than it was in the desert..That was probably due to the greenery all around which afforded a lot of shade.from the hot sun.XYFNKWThere also seemed to be quite a bit of humidity in the air.XYFNKWNot enough to soak your clothes just enough to keep everything green and cool.XYFNKWIt.was like a garden of Eden in the middle of nowhere!As soon as the van was stopped and the Hunts started to get out, they were.greeted by two bellman and a valet..Good afternoon, one of the Bellman said.XYFNKWHe was a tall gangly man with.short cropped blonde hair and spoke with an Australian accent.XYFNKWWelcome to the.Desert Oasis Resort..Thank you, said Mom politely..The other bellman started grabbing luggage from the back of the van and.loaded it up onto his cart.XYFNKWDad handed his keys to the valet and in no time the entire family was inside the main lobby of the resort..The lobby was massive with marble floors and a large circular fountain in the.middle.XYFNKWThe fountain had a large eagle stature in the middle of it.XYFNKWThe eagle had its wings spread, was looking up and seemed as though it just broke through the.surface of the water as it headed skyward, and it had water spraying out of its mouth.XYFNKWDillon thought it looked as though the bird was stuck in an eternal state of puking!XYFNKWAround the main eagle were smaller ones circling it.XYFNKWThey seemed to.be suspended from the ceiling by tiny cables that could barely been seen..Mom and Dad went to the front desk so they could check in while Jordan and Claire waited with the bellman by the cart.XYFNKWDillon and Gwen walked around.in awe of the place.XYFNKWAlmost the entire lobby was made of granite and ornate rocks.XYFNKWThere were nature drawings of the Oasis all over the walls and the smell.of fresh spring water filled the air.XYFNKWThe air inside was just as moist and refreshing as it was on the outside with one exception: it was cooler in the hotel, probably due to the central air conditioning..As Dillon and Gwen walked toward the front desk where Mom and Dad.were, a curious drawing caught Dillon’s eye.XYFNKWThere was a large carved scene on.the wall behind the desk which showed rivers of water flowing through the Oasis.with all types of animals: deer, rabbits, coyotes, and such.XYFNKWAt the very top corner of the carving, beside one of the large leafy trees was a small symbol.XYFNKWAs Dillon’s eyes focused in on it he almost fell over.XYFNKWHis face went pale and he must have had a shocked expression on his face as he felt Gwen tugging at his arm and asking if he was okay..When he came out of his stunned silence, he shook it off and looked down at.her.XYFNKWI’m fine, he said with a weak smile.XYFNKWI’m just … suddenly not feeling well..Mom must have overheard him as she came over and touched his shoulder reassuringly.XYFNKWShe felt his forehead and looked at his eyes.XYFNKWYou don’t feel like you have a fever, and you look fine.XYFNKWIt’ll be okay.XYFNKWWe’ll be in our rooms shortly and then you can lay down for a bit..Dillon smiled again.XYFNKWSo weak was it that he thought for sure Mom would.press on and start asking questions.XYFNKWThankfully she didn’t.XYFNKWHe nodded slightly and glanced back at the wall.XYFNKWThere, by the leaf, was the symbol of a square surrounding a pentagram which had an eye in the center of it.XYFNKWThe only thing missing from it was the writing that was surrounding it.XYFNKWThe symbol was small.and barely noticeable, but Dillon noticed it.XYFNKWIt was the image from his dream!You guys coming?XYFNKWJordan hollered..Dillon stared, still zoned out as he puzzled over the strange symbol he’d seen.now in his dreams and now in real life..Claire shook his shoulder.XYFNKWYou coming?XYFNKWshe repeated..How could that be?XYFNKWDillon screamed in his mind.XYFNKWThen immediately he was struck by the image again, seen at another place.XYFNKWHe now knew that he must have.seen this image at the information center when he was at the counter buying his.books from Tom Tom.XYFNKWAll he knew was that he shook it off as being mistaken..Maybe he wasn’t?In a minute, Dillon replied.XYFNKWWhat room am I in?You’re with Jordan in room 418, Dad responded.XYFNKWEverything okay?Yeah.XYFNKWI just want to ask the girl at the desk a question.XYFNKWI’ll be up there right away..You can ask her your question later, Mom said sternly.XYFNKWRight now, you need to lay down.XYFNKWI’ll bring some ice to your room.XYFNKWMaybe you’re carsick or dehydrated.XYFNKWSome ice water and rest will help with both..I’m really okay Mom, Dillon replied.XYFNKWI’ll only be a minute and then I’ll go and lie down for a bit until I’m feeling better, he pleaded.XYFNKWPromise..Mom looked at Dad for help.XYFNKWHe hesitated for a moment, then nodded.XYFNKWHe’ll.be fine hun.XYFNKWIt’s just for a moment.XYFNKWDon’t be too long, he said to Dillon..Dillon knew he could always count on Dad to give him some much needed.flexibility..Okay, conceded Mom.XYFNKWBut you’re not to be longer than you need to..Jordan, overhearing the exchange from the elevator hollered over, I can’t promise you’ll be able to get in the room!Come on man.XYFNKWToss your brother a key-card, Dad said as he walked over to.the elevator..Jordan sighed, Dad having destroyed the fun he was going to have bugging his brother.XYFNKWGwen giggled.XYFNKWJordan pulled out one of the key-cards and tossed it to Dillon which fell conveniently short of his reach.XYFNKWJordan smirked as though he just had the last word in the conversation..The sleight didn’t phase Dillon as he picked up the card and headed to the front desk.XYFNKWHe had other things on his mind..The woman at the front desk was about average height with short brown hair..She appeared to be in her early to mid twenties and had a slim build and was quite pretty.XYFNKWAs she worked away typing on her computer her head moved to and.away from the screen as she copied whatever information she was working on..When Dillon approached the desk she was so engrossed in her work that she didn’t notice him at first..Excuse me, Dillon said in a soft voice.XYFNKWNo response.XYFNKWExcuse me, he said.again, this time a little louder..The woman seemed startled, but quickly collected herself.XYFNKWOh … sorry.about that, she said..No problem, Dillon replied..What can I do for you?Dillon was silent for a moment, not really knowing how he wanted to.proceed.XYFNKWI was just wondering, he said at length, what is that symbol up on the wall behind you?The woman turned around and scanned the wall.XYFNKWWhat symbol?XYFNKWshe asked..That one over there at the top corner of the leaf, he said as he pointed towards it..The woman looked to where he was motioning.XYFNKWIt took her a moment but she.finally saw what he was curious about.XYFNKWShe looked closer.XYFNKWYou know … I’m not.sure, she replied.XYFNKWI’m actually really new to Oasis Resort and I don’t come from around here.XYFNKWShe turned again toward Dillon.XYFNKWI’m from Canada!XYFNKWThe name’s Janeen, she said with a smile as she stretched out her hand..Oh … uh … I’m Dillon, he replied as the two shook hands..How did you even notice that?XYFNKWJaneen asked in surprise.XYFNKWIt’s so small and.blends in quite well with the surrounding carving..I guess I have a knack for seeing obscure stuff.XYFNKWI also don’t see an artist name anywhere on the wall, he replied as he scanned the rest of the carving..Janeen smiled again.XYFNKWHmmm, that’s weird.XYFNKWYou know what, Dillon?XYFNKWI can ask around for you and let you know what I find out, if anything, she offered..Dillon smiled back and nodded.XYFNKWHe headed for the elevator feeling a little confused and almost sick to his stomach.XYFNKWHow could I have clearly seen this symbol in a dream when I had never been here before, he thought to himself..Maybe I saw it in a book I read, or from some info on-line when I was researching the place?XYFNKWNo, he realized.XYFNKWHe would have remembered reading about it if he had.XYFNKWHe knew he couldn’t dismiss this.XYFNKWThere was something going.on here, and he had to find out what....9.D I S T U R B I N G T H O U G H T S.Dillon found himself sliding through the dark, not knowing where he.would end up.XYFNKWHe could feel his back and legs getting scratched up as.he tumbled down the rocky stairs.XYFNKWFortunately he didn’t seem to hit.his head on the way down.XYFNKWThen, before he knew it, the stairs opened up suddenly into a large cavernous room that was dimly illuminated..Dillon hit the floor and rolled a few feet from the mouth of the stairs.XYFNKWBefore.he fully got his senses back he felt himself being roughly yanked from the floor..Way to go Dil!XYFNKWhis brother yell at him.XYFNKWYou better tell me what’s going on.right now..He looked around stunned.XYFNKWHis brother had a few scratches on his face and.arms.XYFNKWFresh blood slowly showed itself from the many scrapes.XYFNKWSorry, but I was.more concerned about what was chasing us!XYFNKWhe snapped back..Why did you follow me anyway?XYFNKWDillon asked in an accusing tone..Because you seemed so adamant about sneaking out in the middle of the night, Jordan replied.XYFNKWAnd Mom would kill me if I knew you were doing something stupid and didn’t do anything about it!Well … thanks, said Dillon as he began to wipe himself off..Don’t mention it, numbskull.XYFNKWWhere do you think we are anyway?I don’t exactly know, Dillon responded as he started to look around, and take in more of their surroundings.XYFNKWAs he scanned the walls of the large chamber something caught his eye.XYFNKWHe walked towards one of the walls to the side as he..reached in his pocket for his cell phone.XYFNKWHe turned the flashlight function on and shined it at the wall.XYFNKWThe light came on, but immediately dimmed and flickered a little.XYFNKWDillon looked at his phone for a moment, trying to figure out what was happening, but quickly decided to point it at the wall before his battery totally died.XYFNKWThere, etched into the wall was a carving of some sort.XYFNKWAs he looked closer in the dim light he almost fell over as the picture that was etched into the wall was the same square with a pentagram inside of that and an eye inside of that!He was suddenly jolted from his thoughts as Jordan smacked him on the shoulder.XYFNKWBefore he had time to turn around he felt another smack, then he felt.that he was being shaken roughly.XYFNKWHe tried to get away but couldn’t.XYFNKWThe room.began to spin and fade..What are you … he started to say but couldn’t get the rest of the sentence.out..Wake up numbskull, he heard someone say..DILLON OPENED HIS EYES GROGGILY TO SEE JORDAN STANDING OVER HIM.shaking his shoulder..Wake up!XYFNKWJordan said again before walking away into the restroom.XYFNKWMom.and Dad want us ready for breakfast in fifteen minutes..After collecting himself Dillon realized that he must have had another dream..This time it was Jordan that was with him and not Gwen.XYFNKWIt was beginning to get.weird with him seeing that symbol again.XYFNKWHis mind must be working overtime,.he thought to himself.XYFNKWIt was probably due to the carving of it that he saw on the wall behind the guest services desk.XYFNKWEither way, there was now an intense desire in him to try and find out what that symbol meant..Dillon shook off the disturbing thoughts and hurried to get ready.XYFNKWHe quickly.threw on his shorts and t-shirt.XYFNKWThe two quickly exited the room and ran down the hall heading for the elevator.XYFNKWThey saw the door open up and Jordan dashed.inside.XYFNKWDillon quickly sidestepped through the door leading to the stairs as he was determined to beat his brother..He started down as fast as he dared, jumping two steps at a time.XYFNKWHe and Jordan were always in a race when they had places to go, and Dillon was determined that he would beat the elevator down the four flights of stairs.XYFNKWJust as he rounded the last corner down he had to make an emergency push to the side.as he noted, at the last minute, a man coming up the stairs.XYFNKWHe wasn’t able to get completely out of the way and crashed into the man’s shoulder which sent him.flying into the opposite wall.XYFNKWHe hit with a thud and fell to the floor..The man he hit held tightly to the rail so he didn’t topple over..Are you okay?XYFNKWasked the man as he rushed over to stand before Dillon..Dillon looked up and saw a man about six feet tall with a cleanly shaven scalp, and bright blue eyes staring down at him and offering a hand.XYFNKWHe had a large strange looking tattoo on the right side of his bald head that looked like some sort of Asian writing.XYFNKWDillon hesitate for a moment, being taken off guard.by the striking look of the man’s tattoo, then grasped his hand and was hoisted.easily to his feet..There.XYFNKWThat’s better, the man said with a smile.XYFNKWI’m Derek..Dillon smiled back.XYFNKWI’m Dillon, he said.XYFNKWSorry for running into you.XYFNKWIt’s just I ….Derek waved his hand.XYFNKWNo need to explain, he said.XYFNKWI’m just glad you’re.not hurt..Dillon smiled and nodded slightly as he started toward the door that led to the lobby.XYFNKWSee you around Derek!Take care Dillon, Derek replied as he started up the stairs again..Dillon opened the door and was about to exit the stairway when his eye caught a glimpse of something small that was on the ground in the stairwell.XYFNKWHe.quickly backtracked and stooped down to see what it was.XYFNKWIt looked like a small.souvenir coin.XYFNKWIt had the name of the resort on the one side, and, what looked like, a picture of the hotel on the other..Hey Derek, Dillon called to the man who was heading up the stairs.XYFNKWIs this yours?Derek glanced at him and came back down the stairs.XYFNKWAs Dillon stood up he.handed the coin to him..Yes it is, Derek replied.XYFNKWIt must have fallen out of my pocket when we ran into each other..After handling it for a moment he gave it back to Dillon.XYFNKWWhy don’t you keep it.XYFNKWI bought extra anyway from the souvenir shop, and they’re really not that expensive..Oh … okay, Dillon replied as he took the coin back and put it in his pocket.XYFNKWThanks!XYFNKWhe said with a smile..No problem..Dillon turned and burst through the door, seeing Jordan standing in the hall.before him with a smug look on his face..I know, I know, you won this time, Dillon spouted.XYFNKWBut can you get to the.table first?XYFNKWhe asked as he sped by Jordan in a full-tilt run.XYFNKWJordan was taken initially off guard, but quickly responded to the challenge by taking off after his brother.XYFNKWThe two weaved around pedestrian traffic and stationary objects as they sped to the restaurant, only slowing down when they came into view of Mom, Dad, Claire, and Gwen sitting at a table near the front of the entrance to the restaurant..As they approached, Jordan gave Dillon a quick shot in the arm before they.sat down..What took you guys so long?XYFNKWDad asked..Oh nothing, Jordan responded.XYFNKWJust trying to get sleeping beauty here out.of bed.XYFNKWThat’s all..Claire laughed..So what do you guys think of this place so far?XYFNKWasked Mom from behind an.upraised menu..That comment started a barrage of discussion from the Hunt kids,.particularly from Gwen, who was always hard pressed to keep quiet.XYFNKWAs the others talked, Dillon absently traced the symbol he had seen in his dreams on the table with his finger.XYFNKWThe words of the others washed over him, but he couldn’t.concentrate..Dillon, are you okay?XYFNKWhis Mom asked..Dillon looked up in surprise and blinked.XYFNKWUh, yeah.XYFNKWSure.XYFNKWHe dropped his.gaze back to the table and frowned.XYFNKWHe’d even drawn the symbol in his syrup..He scribbled it out with his fork, heart pounding..When he looked up, he saw his mom still watching him.XYFNKWHe winced and looked away..What’s going on Dillon?XYFNKWhis mom asked, concern etched on her face..Dillon shifted uneasily.XYFNKWNothing, he said.XYFNKWI just … didn’t have a very good.night sleep..Jordan snorted.XYFNKWPlease!XYFNKWI could barely wake you this morning..Dillon shrugged, not willing to be goaded into another useless argument with.his brother..Mom did not look convinced but didn’t press the matter further..To him, playing a character in an adventure was one thing, but trying to fake.being okay when, in fact, his mind was a mile away was another.XYFNKWHe was disturbed by the events of the last couple days, especially by the dreams he was having and the mysterious symbol that kept showing up.XYFNKWHe knew that he couldn’t tell anyone about the dreams and the symbol because he would just sound crazy.XYFNKWHe felt that no one would believe him especially given the fact that he always made up all sorts of crazy stories that he played out in his adventures..The problem with this one is that it was real..So what’s the plan today then?XYFNKWClaire interjected, after she saw that Dillon’s and Jordan’s conversation was going nowhere..Oh I don’t know, responded Dad.XYFNKWWhat do you guys want to do today?XYFNKWI.for one would like some relaxation by the pool..Gwen perked up at that.XYFNKWShe loved swimming.XYFNKWJordan and Claire both.nodded in ascent at the idea..Sure.XYFNKWSounds good to me, Dillon put it, not wanting to be the odd-man out..Okay, kids, so we’re doing pool time and then maybe a tour of the area, right?XYFNKWMom asked, whipping out her phone.XYFNKWHer fingers typed on the keyboard..The kids all noticed how Mom took Dad’s suggestion of pool-time and then added a tour.XYFNKWThat’s how Mom operated.XYFNKWShe was always trying to cram as much.activity as she could into their vacations.XYFNKWIt was never enough for her to just.relax and take it easy.XYFNKWThe kids were used to it by now and just kind of rolled with it..Dad rolled his eyes and put an arm around her shoulder.XYFNKWHoney, we’re on vacation.XYFNKWWe don’t need to plan every minute..Mom scowled at Dad.XYFNKWBut we do need to know where everyone is going to.be.XYFNKWWhat if something happens?Uh-oh, Mom’s going full CSS on us!XYFNKWDillon said with a grin..CSS?XYFNKWGwen asked..Constant Surveillance System, Dillon explained..Mom rolled her eyes while Jordan and Claire snickered.XYFNKWBetter safe than sorry.XYFNKWNow, everyone’s phones out.XYFNKWLet’s get this calendar synched!Dillon wasn’t keen about spending time on a tour of the town.XYFNKWHe wanted to.explore more of the resort instead.XYFNKWHe was sure that there would be more potential clues to the mystery of the symbol and he couldn’t wait to start hunting for them..He looked over to Dad.XYFNKWIf you don’t mind, Dad, I’d just like to hang out here for a bit today, he said.XYFNKWCan I pass on the trip to town?Are you sure?XYFNKWhe asked.XYFNKWIt’s gonna be pretty cool exploring the town..Ya, I’m sure, Dillon responded.XYFNKWBesides we’re going to be here for a while anyway.XYFNKWI’ll have lots of time to explore..What do you think babe?XYFNKWDad turned and asked Mom..Well, I’m concerned that you’ll be here all alone.XYFNKWShe paused for a moment.before continuing.XYFNKWBut … I guess if you stay on the resort property, keep your.phone close, and stay in populated areas it should be okay as long as you promise to stay out of trouble..Dillon smiled.XYFNKWCome on.XYFNKWWhat could possibly happen?If you’re really concerned about it, I’ll stay here and keep an eye on him,.Jordan piped in..Mom smiled.XYFNKWThanks Jordan.XYFNKWThat would ease my concern..No problem.XYFNKWAlways trying to help..Ya right, Claire said under her breath..What was that?XYFNKWJordan snapped at her angrily..Oh nothing, she replied innocently.XYFNKWEnjoy your time here with Dillon..She gave him one of those sarcastic smiles..Dillon just shook his head and let his brother and sister go at it.XYFNKWHe knew when not to get in the middle of one of their tiffs..Instead, he looked down, about to cut into his pancakes, when he saw it again.XYFNKWThere, in front of him was the symbol he had drawn into his syrup again,.which shocked him more than he thought it should have.XYFNKWHe had a feeling that he.was losing control of himself and it scared him.XYFNKWHe had no idea what was happening to him, but he knew he needed to find out.XYFNKWHe needed to find out fast....10.T H E M A N I N T H E P I C T U R E.After breakfast was done, and the family enjoyed a couple hours by the.pool the Hunts, with the exception of Dillon and Jordan, packed their day-trip gear and boarded the small shuttle bus that headed to town..Don’t forget to keep an eye on your brother, Mom instructed Jordan before.they left..Ya ya … I got this, Jordan replied as he settled back down in his deck chair..After they left Dillon turned to his brother.XYFNKWMom just said you had to keep.an eye on me..Jordan rolled his eyes.XYFNKWSure, I’ll keep an eye on you every time you come to.the pool.XYFNKWAnd when you do you gotta make sure you stay away from me so you.don’t ruin my game!Game?XYFNKWDillon asked with a snort.XYFNKWI kept track of your ‘game’ on the way.down here.XYFNKWTrust me, you’re better off with me.XYFNKWHe danced out of the way as Jordan aimed a punch for his shoulder..Just don’t tell mom and you can do what you want, Jordan said..Dillon shrugged.XYFNKWSure thing..In truth, Dillon didn’t want Jordan anywhere near him while he was.researching the symbol.XYFNKWBut any opportunity he had in order to get a dig in at his brother he would take...DILLON WAS DETERMINED TO USE EVERY POSSIBLE RESOURCE HE COULD IN ORDER.to find out about this symbol.XYFNKWHe was actually really tempted to relax with Jordan by the pool as he did have a sleepless night, but the fear of seeing the symbol again in his dreams pushed him to pursue its meaning instead..The most likely place he could think of to start looking was in his book about.John Taylor Sebastian.XYFNKWIf anyone knew what this meant it would definitely be him, he reasoned to himself.XYFNKWIf that didn’t have anything then he would look in.every book, brochure, and on-line literature that he could find on the place..After gathering up all the resources he could find about Desert Oasis Resort.he parked himself in the business center which was by the lobby.XYFNKWIt was nice and quiet in that room and there were computer terminals he could access to do his.research.XYFNKWIt was perfect!XYFNKWThe best part about it was that there were free cookies, muffins, and fruit which were laid out in the room for those who needed a snack.while they worked on whatever it was that they were doing..Dillon walked over and grabbed a few nice big chocolate chip cookies from.under the tray lid and marched back to where he had set up camp.XYFNKWHe began.flipping through the book on John Taylor Sebastian.XYFNKWAs he thumbed through the.pages he scanned the text for anything that would remotely describe the symbol..While looking at the photographs that were in the book of John, his colleagues,.and some of the surrounding territory, he held them up every which way to see if he could see some sign of the symbol.XYFNKWNothing.XYFNKWHe must have looked for about.an hour through that book but couldn’t find even a trace.XYFNKWHe then resorted to his other pieces of literature and then finally the internet.XYFNKWNothing.XYFNKWIt was incredibly frustrating!After taking a bit of a break to stretch his legs and grab another cookie Dillon decided to go back to reading the book on John Taylor Sebastian.XYFNKWHe flipped through it slowly this time, reading more of the text in detail.XYFNKWIt was actually kind of interesting.XYFNKWJohn apparently was a celebrated archeologist before he ever tried to discover the source of the Oasis.XYFNKWHe had numerous findings to his name, including some long lost south American tribes that were, up to the.time he investigated, considered myths.XYFNKWThe introduction to the book described him as a strong, polite, quiet man who spent countless hours pouring over books.in search of some missing detail that he believed would unlock the whole mystery of what he was researching.XYFNKWThere was, however, another side to him that described him as adventurous and an avid outdoorsman.XYFNKWApparently he never married as his work kept him away from home far too much..As Dillon read about this man he began to feel as though he knew him somehow like they had a connection that was seen in common interests.XYFNKWOf course John had years of study and field experience to his name while Dillon had imaginary adventures and a weird gift for finding stuff.XYFNKWThis, Dillon figured, drew a line of difference between the two—a big line..As he read on, he found that John was skeptical about the length of time the.Oasis was active.XYFNKWFrom what Dillon had researched on the net earlier it said that the Oasis was formed in the 1800’s, but John had compelling evidence that it actually wasn’t that long ago.XYFNKWHe figured it was only about five to ten years old.—around 2008 to 2013!XYFNKWDillon sat back pondering the thought..How could this have been kept such a secret for so long?XYFNKWWas it because it.was on private property?XYFNKWDillon thought to himself.XYFNKWAnd how come there is very little contradictory evidence to these facts in any other research that was around?XYFNKWUnless someone was trying to cover it up..John, according to the book, figured just that: that someone, for whatever reason, was trying to keep the recent origin of the Oasis a secret.XYFNKWDillon had heard Mom and Dad discuss the modern phenomenon of misinformation that happens in today’s world while they watched the news at home.XYFNKWThey always marvelled at the amount of contrary facts that people put out there, but Dillon never really understood that idea.XYFNKWTo him, it was just the world he was growing.up in, and he figured that it was just life.XYFNKWNow, however, he was put in a position where he had to sort out what was true and what was false.XYFNKWThis now gave him a.better idea of what Mom and Dad were talking about, and he felt a little frustrated at having to find out what was true and what was false..Further pondering this Dillon turned the page as he was reading and saw the.first picture that was in the book.XYFNKWIt was a photo taken of John and a few others.when they arrived at the Oasis in 2016 to begin their research.XYFNKWThere were four men and a woman in the photograph.XYFNKWThe woman and three of the men were apparently John’s field workers that were supporting him on this investigation, but the fourth man was a native man.XYFNKWEverything in the picture was crisp and clear except for this man’s face.XYFNKWIt seemed that the resolution was off on him, as if the camera or the lighting was somehow off, or someone was trying to deliberately mask who it was.XYFNKWThe bottom of the photo indicated that his name.was Tokala Tenderfoot..He went to the computer and typed in all of the names on the picture into the.search engine.XYFNKWAll of them came up as being field archeologists that went missing the same time John did, except Tokala Tenderfoot.XYFNKWHis name had no reference to the man Dillon was seeing in the picture.XYFNKWHe was about to open another search window when the lights in the business center flickered then went out his computer screen went black.XYFNKWHe looked around wondering what had happened..An older man noticed the confused look on Dillon’s face and said, Don’t worry son, it’s just a temporary blackout.XYFNKWThe power will be back on any moment..Sure enough, right after he spoke the light came to life again..See?XYFNKWthe man commented..Dillon nodded.XYFNKWThanks, he replied, then he went back to the book and tried.to get a better look.XYFNKWHe figured the computer would be useless so he just left it off.XYFNKWThen he had an idea!XYFNKWHe pulled out his phone and took a picture of the picture with the camera app.XYFNKWHe then used his fingers to zoom in and turn the photo in different ways, trying to see it in different angles.XYFNKWHe squinted his eyes as he looked harder at the picture.XYFNKWEven though it pixelated when he zoomed in.he was able to make out more detail.XYFNKWThat looks like— His mouth dropped open as he suddenly recognized the man.XYFNKWIt was Tom Tom!The revelation knocked him back.XYFNKWTom Tom must have been John’s guide.while he was here.XYFNKWIf anyone knew what had happened to John he would!XYFNKWDillon.sat back for a moment trying to digest the information.XYFNKWThere’s something going on here, he said to himself...Eh!XYFNKWcame a call from the older man at one of the computer terminals beside him.XYFNKWDid you say something boy?Dillon blushed a little.XYFNKWAh … No.XYFNKWJust talking to myself, he admitted..It was Tom Tom who led me to this book, he thought to himself.XYFNKWI wonder if that wasn’t an accident?Dillon quickly packed up his stuff and headed for the bell desk.XYFNKWHe knew now what he had to do..There, at the desk, was the tall gangly Australian who helped the Hunts with.their luggage when they first arrived.XYFNKWHe looked as though he was trying to appear busy, but Dillon could totally see through him.XYFNKWHe was bored out of his.mind!Hey … um … Dillon started to say, trying to remember if he ever did get.the guy’s name when they checked in..The Australian looked at him then smiled.XYFNKWMy name’s Keith mate, he said.in his thick Australian accent.XYFNKWBut everyone just calls me Aussie..Oh … okay Aussie.XYFNKWI was wondering if you guys rented Bikes around.here?Sure thing … he paused, looking inquisitive.XYFNKWWhat was your name.again?Oh … Dillon.XYFNKWDillon Hunt..Right!XYFNKWThe Hunt family.XYFNKWNow I remember!XYFNKWIf you head about half way down.the resort, through those doors and to the right you run right into the rental shops..Thanks man!XYFNKWDillon replied as he started off, hoisting his backpack higher.onto his shoulder.XYFNKWI mean, mate, he corrected..Aussie smiled and waved goodbye as Dillon exited the main lobby..AS FAR AS RENTAL SHOPS WENT THIS PLACE WAS PRETTY AWESOME IN DILLON’S.estimation.XYFNKWThere were tons of equipment and outdoor games that could be rented from boats, to bikes, and even small off-road buggies.XYFNKWDillon paused at.the buggies for a moment then shook the thought away..Dad would kill me when he saw the cost of this added to the bill!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWNo, he realized that he could easily explain the twenty or so dollars to rent a bike for the afternoon as opposed to the mini dune buggy.XYFNKWStill … he continued to imagine what it would be like to whip across the desert hills in one of these bad boys as he stroked the protective cage that gave the buggy its form and awesome look.XYFNKWFinally he was jolted back to reality by a voice coming from.behind him..Can I help you with something?XYFNKWa woman asked..Dillon turned around to see an older native lady standing there smiling at him.XYFNKWHe noticed that her name tag said Tara..Can I help you find something?XYFNKWshe asked again with that disarming smile..Ah … yeah … Dillon stumbled as he was pulled back into reality.XYFNKWI would like to rent a bike, he replied..Okay.XYFNKWWhat kind of bike?Dillon looked around the shop.XYFNKWSomething that’s good for the desert dunes.just in case I want to do some off-roading, he said.XYFNKWSomething like that.XYFNKWHe.pointed at a stylish looking BMX that was hanging from the ceiling on a hook.amidst a number of other styles of bikes hanging in the same row.XYFNKWIt was a Redline Proline Pro BMX race bike.XYFNKWIt was similar to the one he had at home except way more expensive.XYFNKWIt was top-of-the-line, made with the best.components, and was super light!XYFNKWDespite some of the other kids at the track having these bad boys he was never able to try one..Okay, Tara replied as she headed around the desk.XYFNKWI’ll get my helper to pull it down for you.XYFNKWShe turned and yelled, Trent!XYFNKWI need you to get a bike down for me..After a moment a young native boy about Dillon’s age came out of the back.room..How would you like to pay for that?XYFNKWTara asked..Dillon held up his room key.XYFNKWCan I just put it on my room?Sure thing, she said, holding out her hand.XYFNKWShe swiped the card and then typed in some numbers before handing the card back to Dillon..Will there be anything else for you?Just a helmet if you could.XYFNKWA fully enclosed BMX one if you have it,.Dillon responded..No problem, the woman smiled..After a few moments the young native boy handed Dillon the bike.XYFNKWThanks.man, Dillon said..No problem, the young boy replied.XYFNKWJust be careful of what’s out in the desert.XYFNKWAnd make sure you’re back before dark..Dillon looked at him curiously..What I mean is that there’s snakes by day, coyotes at night, and other things.that you need to avoid..Oh … Okay, Dillon replied.XYFNKWMaybe I should have read a little bit of that book about the creatures of the desert I got from the information center, he thought to himself..Where are you headed anyway?XYFNKWthe boy asked..Just to the information center..Oh.XYFNKWIt should be a good ride then.XYFNKWThe path is a little hilly, but it shouldn’t take that long and it’s well traveled by others who want to experience the desert scenery.XYFNKWBesides, there are a ton of good jumps and smaller side trails that should make the ride way more fun!XYFNKWThe boy smiled wide at that last remark..Thanks.XYFNKWWhat path?XYFNKWDillon asked..This one, the boy responded as he reached onto the counter and grabbed a.small brochure.XYFNKWHe unfolded it and handed it to Dillon.XYFNKWIt was a map of the Oasis and surrounding area.XYFNKWOn it were a number of trails through the desert.XYFNKWOne of.the trails led right to the info center that was a few miles out of town..If you take the trail your time will be way better than going on the highway..It will take about ten minutes and it’s a lot more fun, Trent said..You enjoy yourself, Tara said as she handed Dillon the helmet she pulled.from the counter.XYFNKWJust make sure the bike’s back by the end of the day or we’ll have to charge you for another full day, she warned..No problem.XYFNKWEnd of the day.XYFNKWGot it.XYFNKWAvoid dangerous creatures.XYFNKWGot it.XYFNKWHave.fun and take lots of jumps.XYFNKWGot it!XYFNKWhe responded as he exited....11.T O M T O M A N D J O H N T A Y L O R S E B A S T I A N.Dillon was amazed at the clear dividing line between where the Oasis.ended and the desert started.XYFNKWHe noticed it on the way in, but it had a.different impact on him now that he was biking through it.XYFNKWIt was.almost as though there was some sort of invisible wall between the lush green ground and the rocky, sandy, sterile land.XYFNKWAs Dillon rode across the line he looked up and down the distance of the lush green land.XYFNKWThe Oasis was huge!XYFNKWIt.went in each direction for quite a few miles he estimated and then turned back.toward the way he came.XYFNKWAnd it wasn’t just a straight line, it zigged and zagged, but everywhere it turned there was definitely a clear line of separation between the Oasis and the desert..As he continued down the rocky trail on his BMX he remembered reading that the really weird thing about the Oasis is that it never grew or diminished in the few years it had been around.XYFNKWThis information came directly from personal.testimony of the people who lived here.XYFNKWOf course no one who was an outsider.really knew for sure as the tribal owners had been pretty protective of letting others on their land in order to conduct tests.XYFNKWAs a matter of fact the books Dillon was reading seemed to indicate that John Taylor Sebastian was the only one with.almost unlimited access to the resort in order to carry out his investigations.XYFNKWIt wasn’t really clear why John Taylor Sebastian was the only one with this kind of access.XYFNKWWhat was clear was that he, and members of his team, were the only ones to have gone missing.XYFNKWDillon’s gut told him that there was a connection to.this he just didn’t know what that was yet..The trail to the information center was just as awesome as the boy at the rental place said it would be.XYFNKWThe suspension on the BMX was put to the test as.Dillon pounded over the hard rocky surface and dipped down into the low gullies.XYFNKWHe got air more than enough.XYFNKWAnd the speed he could get at certain points was amazing!XYFNKWHe was truly in his element..As he flew over the next jump he started to picture himself riding a futuristic.motorcycle that used antigravity technology to keep it just above the ground..The desert track suddenly turned into a concrete highway in his mind’s eye.XYFNKWHe.found himself cruising by other cars and bikes at 250 miles per hour.XYFNKWThe rush.was incredible!He looked to his belt and noted the MX1500 machine pistol strapped there..For now, he was Agent Dexter Malone of the Twilight City Central Police Department (TCCP).XYFNKWHe looked forward again and saw the woman he was.hunting down: Deborah Gale, also known as The Night Hawk..The TCCP had been trying to catch The Night Hawk for months as she was.wanted for multiple charges of robbery and murder, most notably the robbery of.Princeton Techs newest invention, a super soldier serum known as Weapon 10..Word was that she was going to sell it to the highest bidder on the dark web..With that serum in the wrong hands, the world would be plunged into chaos..Malone couldn’t let that happen..He jammed the bike into a higher gear and hit the accelerator to max.XYFNKWHis bike roared and took off.XYFNKWThe Night Hawk looked back and saw Malone catching.up.XYFNKWShe reached down, drew her gun from its holster, and started firing at the daring Agent..Malone swerved and veered, all the while keeping his eye on the target.XYFNKWHe.ducked in and out of traffic with deadly precision..Put the weapon down, and surrender, Malone said, his helmet amplifying.his voice so that she could hear him.XYFNKWYou have one chance, he warned..The only response he received was her jamming down on the accelerator and.pulling away from him..He smiled.XYFNKWGood.XYFNKWThis should be fun, he said to himself..With lighting speed he pulled his MX1500 and fired a single shot.XYFNKWThe bullet grazed The Night Hawk’s hand and drove into the accelerator.XYFNKWHer bike started to slow instantly as she retracted her hand, obviously in pain.XYFNKWAs Malone quickly neared her he leaped from the seat, keeping both his hands on the handle bars,.and spun both his legs around, kicking her in the side which sent her flying from her bike..He smiled again, knowing that there was no way The Night Hawk was.getting away from him..Before Dillon could finish his imaginary adventure he came into view of the.back side of the info center.XYFNKWHe cleared his head, and came back to reality, parking his bike off to the side and went right to the front door.XYFNKWHe stopped for a moment and looked around.XYFNKWIt was eerily quiet as there didn’t seem to be anyone.around.XYFNKWHe noted two vehicles in the parking lot but other than that there was not a trace of anyone, or anything else, except for the odd tumble weed here and there blowing across the highway.XYFNKWHe shrugged it off and pushed on the door.XYFNKWIt.didn’t open.XYFNKWHe tried again but realized that it was locked.XYFNKWHe looked at the hours of operation sign and noted that the place should be open right now..Dillon got a shiver down his back.XYFNKWHe knew something was wrong.XYFNKWHe.looked around for a moment and pressed his face up against the glass, trying to.get a look of what was going on inside if he could.XYFNKWEverything seemed quiet..Maybe I’m overreacting?XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWRight … In the middle of the day with two vehicles parked out front when the store hours clearly indicate that it’s supposed to be open and it’s not even lunch yet.XYFNKWIt’s all just a little too suspicious..He moved to the side and around the building searching for another way in..He found a side door but that too was locked.XYFNKWAs he moved around he noticed a.window about six feet off the ground that was wound open about ten inches.XYFNKWIt.was clearly too small an opening for most people, but fortunately Dillon was still only twelve and hadn’t filled out yet.XYFNKWHe figured he could fit through if he could get a boost.XYFNKWHe searched around a little more and found a garbage can that would be perfect for him use..Before he proceeded any further he decided that he should probably look up.the phone number and see if anyone would pick up first.XYFNKWHe wasn’t keen on breaking and entering and figured he should try this first.XYFNKWThe phone rang and rang until the voicemail engaged..Hi.XYFNKWThanks for calling the Desert Oasis Information Center, a woman’s voice said.XYFNKWOur hours of operation are from 8 AM to 8 PM, Monday to Friday,.and 8 AM to 5 PM on Saturday and Sunday.XYFNKWIf you would like to leave a message please do so after the tone.XYFNKWThank you..Dillon hung up.XYFNKWIt should be open right now.XYFNKWThat knowledge gave Dillon a.sinking feeling.XYFNKWHe didn’t want to believe it, but he started to think that something was wrong.XYFNKWHe needed to get inside..After positioning the trash can, he hoisted himself up.XYFNKWBefore entering he took off his backpack and squeezed it through the window.XYFNKWHe kept a firm hold.on the bag as he squirmed through, not wanting it to make any noise inside the.building if he let it drop to the floor.XYFNKWAbout halfway through he paused for a moment and listened while he looked around inside the room, just to make sure.no one was there.XYFNKWEven for him the fit through the window was tight!XYFNKWBut he somehow managed to get through anyway.XYFNKWOnce inside he quickly looked.around and tried to get his bearings.XYFNKWHe apparently snuck into the small coffee room that the employees used for their break times.XYFNKWThere were a couple tables,.some chairs, a counter with a coffee pot on it, a fridge in the corner, and a small flat screen TV hanging on the wall..Dillon noticed the half-opened door directly across from where he had.entered the room.XYFNKWHe crept silently to the door and slowly peeked his head out,.looking both ways down the adjoining hallway to see if anyone was there.XYFNKWIt was.empty.XYFNKWAs he moved from the room he heard some muffled speaking coming from down the hall.XYFNKWSlowly he walked toward the muffled conversation, careful.to watch every footfall so as not to alert anyone to his presence..As he neared the end of the hallway he could hear the conversation.becoming more clear.XYFNKWHe definitely recognized one of the voices.XYFNKWIt was Tom Tom..I told you before.XYFNKWI don’t know what happened to him!XYFNKWTom Tom stated emphatically..I don’t think you realize what danger exists here, the other man replied..Dillon couldn’t help but think that the other man’s voice seemed familiar somehow but he just couldn’t place it..I know very well what these people are capable of and ….That’s why you refuse to give me the information I need, the other man finished..No … no … it’s not that.XYFNKWListen, if I could help you I would, Tom Tom replied.XYFNKWJohn was my friend.XYFNKWI never wanted anything bad to happen to him..So you say..Yes!XYFNKWOf course!XYFNKWHow dare you accuse me of helping to harm my friend!Tom Tom cried in rage..So he’s been harmed?XYFNKWthe man questioned slyly..No!XYFNKWI didn’t mean … I don’t know … You’re confusing me, Tom Tom.said.XYFNKWPlease, just leave..Not until you start being straight with me!XYFNKWthe man said, raising his voice.for effect..Dillon thought for sure that a fight was about to break out.XYFNKWOut of instinct he.looked around for an escape route just to make sure he could run to safety before calling for help..I am being straight with you, he heard Tom Tom reply in a barely audible.voice.XYFNKWQuiet sniffles followed Tom Tom’s statement.XYFNKWA moment later, Dillon heard someone blowing their nose.XYFNKWHe could almost feel the tears welling up in.the old man’s eyes.XYFNKWA long awkward silence ensued..Okay, replied the other man finally.XYFNKWBut if you hear, see, or suddenly remember anything at all, please give me a call..Dillon heard footsteps coming toward the hallway where he was.XYFNKWHe quickly.shuffled back the way he had come and tucked into the coffee room again, hiding around the partially opened door.XYFNKWHe could hear the footsteps get louder.until they were right at the door.XYFNKWThen they stopped.XYFNKWDillon could hear his heart pound.XYFNKWIt felt as though his chest was going to explode.XYFNKWHe didn’t dare breathe..Then the steps moved on.XYFNKWDillon let out a sigh of relief.XYFNKWHe knew he should have tried to get a look at who it was that was arguing with Tom Tom, but he couldn’t.move..After a moment he was able to finally collect himself and came back out of.the room.XYFNKWOkay, he said to himself.XYFNKWYou can do this.XYFNKWYou can do this..He heard the front door to the info center open and close the distinctive chimes on the door ringing out from the movement.XYFNKWNow that the other man was.gone Dillon didn’t feel the need to employ as much stealth as he had before, so.he hurried down the hall and into the room where Tom Tom was..Even though he had only met Tom Tom once, he had a strange feeling that he.could trust the guy.XYFNKWMaybe it was his boyhood naiveté?XYFNKWHe wasn’t sure, but he.felt driven to know what happened to John and he needed Tom Tom’s help..Despite the fact that he just overheard a conversation where Tom Tom denied knowing where John was, he still felt there was information the old man could.share that might shed some light on this mystery..The back room was large and full of various merchandise—boxed and.otherwise.XYFNKWDillon noticed that there was a large table near the back with three chairs scattered around it in no organized fashion.XYFNKWAs he entered the room he immediately saw Tom Tom leaning over the table with his hands firmly planted.against it.XYFNKWHe appeared to be mumbling to himself.XYFNKWTom Tom shot his head up,.alerted to Dillon’s presence when he entered the room.XYFNKWThe old man’s eyes were.red and teary.XYFNKWHe looked confused when he saw Dillon standing there looking at.him..What are you doing here?XYFNKWhe asked..Oh … I … Dillon stumbled for a reply.XYFNKWIt was as though all of his confidence left him at once and he couldn’t think of a good answer to give the.clearly shaken man.XYFNKWI … he tried again..Well?XYFNKWTom Tom pressed more forcefully..I just wanted to ask you some questions, Dillon blurted, realizing at that moment that he should have prepared himself more for this meeting.XYFNKWIt also just.dawned on him that he was just about to ask Tom Tom about John Taylor Sebastian, which was no doubt the same John the man who the previous guy just.asked him about which was the very conversation that made Tom Tom visibly shaken and upset.XYFNKWHow Stupid!XYFNKWhe thought to himself..About what?XYFNKWTom Tom asked sceptically.XYFNKWHow much did you hear?Dillon froze and the blood drained from his face.XYFNKWA huge lump welled up in.his throat.XYFNKWHe didn’t know what to say..What does it matter anyway?XYFNKWa resigned Tom Tom finally said at length as.he sat down in the chair closest to him.XYFNKWWhat are you curious about Mr.XYFNKWHunt?Dillon relaxed at that and moved closer, grabbing a seat across from the old.man.XYFNKWI was reading up on … he began but then paused, not sure how Tom Tom would take the next statement, … on John Taylor Sebastian and ….And you want to know how much I knew him?XYFNKWthe old man cut in..Well I saw a picture of him and his team in the book I purchased from your.store and noticed that you were in it, Dillon stated..Tom Tom’s shoulders shrunk a little.XYFNKWYes I knew him, he said.XYFNKWHe was my.friend.XYFNKWNot that they would believe me, he finished, waving a hand at the door.to indicate the man who had just left..Dillon looked from the door back to Tom Tom.XYFNKWWho are they?XYFNKWhe asked..Aren’t you a little young to be asking such questions?XYFNKWTom Tom put in..Shouldn’t you be enjoying yourself with your family and the other kids at the.resort?I would, but I can’t get the thought of John Taylor Sebastian and the mystery he was investigating out of my mind.XYFNKWIt’s as though I am driven for some reason to help uncover what has happened here.XYFNKWDillon paused for a moment.XYFNKWI can’t explain it, he finally said in a soft voice..Dillon, you’re just a boy!XYFNKWTom Tom exclaimed, almost pleading with him..You shouldn’t be asking these questions or worried about these events.XYFNKWThey happened and no one can change that.XYFNKWOthers three times your age have come here and failed to find what they were looking for.XYFNKWWhat makes you think you can crack this when they haven’t been able to?Dillon was hit hard by Tom Tom’s words.XYFNKWUp to this point he never thought.that he couldn’t do what others failed to do.XYFNKWHe seemed to possess a confidence.that was innate—apart from age, circumstance, or training.XYFNKWIt had never occurred to him until now that he was way over his head.XYFNKWMaybe Tom Tom is right, he thought to himself.XYFNKWMaybe I should just go and be a kid have fun at the resort.and forget all this nonsense?I don’t know, he said in a barely audible tone..He was about to turn and walk away when Tom Tom said, I can’t tell you.much Dillon.XYFNKWI warned John that the investigation was dangerous but he wouldn’t listen to me..Dillon thought for a moment.XYFNKWDangerous how?XYFNKWhe pressed..I can’t explain it, and you need to drop it as well, Tom Tom said firmly..No one else is going to get hurt because of this, he vowed.XYFNKWThis is dangerous in the way that experienced explorers have gone missing … never to be heard of.again.XYFNKWDo you want your family going home without you, never knowing what.happened to you?Dillon swallowed hard as a chill went down his back.XYFNKWHe hadn’t reasoned it.out that way yet.XYFNKWWhat if the old man was right?XYFNKWHe couldn’t deny the logic of it..Tom Tom must have noticed the look in Dillon’s face as the revelation struck.him.XYFNKWGo and enjoy your vacation Dillon, he said softly..Dillon nodded slightly.XYFNKWHe was about to leave but knew he had to ask one more question.XYFNKWWhat do you know about a symbol that is shaped like a boxed-in pentagram with an eye in the middle of it?Tom Tom looked hard at Dillon for a moment then said, I don’t know anything about that.XYFNKWI’ve never seen anything like that before..Dillon nodded, then headed for the door.XYFNKWHe wasn’t sure if Tom Tom was telling the truth, but he knew he wasn’t going to get anything else out of the man..He suddenly stopped before leaving and looked back at the emotionally.battered man.XYFNKWAnswer me honestly, he said.XYFNKWDo you know how this Oasis came into being?Tom Tom looked at him in the eyes.XYFNKWNo, he replied.XYFNKWMe and the rest of the.tribe were enlisted just before the resort was built.XYFNKWWe were convinced that the Oasis was naturally occurring and were promised jobs and financial stability..The tribal leaders showed us a model of what they wanted to do for this area and it excited us..Our tribe was suffering and we wanted a sense of well-being and.accomplishment so we went along without asking any questions.XYFNKWWe trusted the elders and their business partners who made the proposal to us.XYFNKWIt wasn’t until John came here and started asking questions that I too got curious, but of course no one would tell us anything than what they already had..Who were the business partners?I don’t know, replied Tom Tom.XYFNKWEverything seemed legit, so we didn’t press for details..Did John tell you why he was investigating the origin of the Oasis?No.XYFNKWHe never fully revealed his intent, but I got the sense that there were some shady circumstances surrounding it.XYFNKWBefore I had a chance to pry any more.out of him he disappeared.XYFNKWIt was then that I realized there was more going on.here than the leaders let us know.XYFNKWI tried to talk to them, but they more or less implied that people who ask too many question tend to go missing.XYFNKWTom Tom.wiped a tear from his eye..Dillon nodded then turned and walked through the door..He headed down the hallway and into the main lobby of the information center.XYFNKWAs he walked by the front counter something caught his eye.XYFNKWHe glanced.over and saw the reflection of a familiar looking symbol bouncing off some aviator-style sunglasses that were hanging on a rack on the counter.XYFNKWHe walked.over and around the rack and there, etched into the wood of the inside of the counter opposite the glasses was the all-too-familiar square shape with a pentagram inside of it with a single eye in the middle of that.XYFNKWDillon was rocked back on his heels and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up..Tom Tom was lying about this, he whispered to himself.XYFNKWHe had to know this was here!He turned around quickly and started toward the hallway again but froze..There, in front of the hallway was a large coyote with yellow glowing eyes, staring at him.XYFNKWIt bared its fangs as thick saliva dripped from its mouth....12.C O Y O T E S.The coyote lunged.XYFNKWDillon barely managed to get out of the way.XYFNKWIt.slammed into a rack of clothing and got hung up for a moment.XYFNKWDillon.pulled himself off the floor and frantically looked for something to.defend himself with.XYFNKWThe coyote extracted itself and lunged again.XYFNKWDillon managed to throw another rack of clothing in its way.XYFNKWThe impact pushed Dillon.aside and, as he fell, he felt a long hard object beside him as he scrambled along the floor.XYFNKWHe realized at that moment that it was a broom.XYFNKWAs he got his bearing again he grabbed onto the broom and shot it out in front of him just in time.XYFNKWThe coyote bit down on the wooden shaft.XYFNKWIt was only inches from his face.XYFNKWHe could.smell its foul rotten breath..A small drop of saliva dripped from its mouth onto Dillon’s hand.XYFNKWOh it burned!XYFNKWDillon could feel the pain.XYFNKWHe screamed out.XYFNKWWith all his strength he pushed the broom to the side and squirmed out from underneath the creature.XYFNKWAs.it went to reposition its grip on the shaft Dillon yanked it from its mouth and swung it quickly around, slamming the creature in the face.XYFNKWThe shock of the blow from the hit jarred the broom from his hand and it fell to the side.XYFNKWThe coyote also flew to the side from the impact.XYFNKWAs it struggled to get up again Dillon turned and ran for the hallway as quickly as he could.XYFNKWHe knew he didn’t.have time to pick up the broom as the creature appeared to be starting to recover already.XYFNKWHe also knew he had to warn Tom Tom and couldn’t spare a second..He raced down the hall as fast as his legs would carry him.XYFNKWHe could hear.that the creature had collected its senses again and was in pursuit.XYFNKWAs Dillon neared the end of the hallway he spun into the room, bouncing a little off the door frame as he couldn’t enter the room cleanly because of the momentum he.had gained from the run.XYFNKWHe sprawled into a couple of boxes and then onto his.back.XYFNKWHe saw the coyote slam into the wall at the end of the hallway as it leaped for him just as he turned into the room.XYFNKWIts ugly face went through the drywall.and it landed hard on the ground.XYFNKWDillon didn’t wait to see if it was dead.XYFNKWHe scrambled back away from the door, turned as he went, and jumped to his feet..His heart sank as he saw the smashed boxes and overturned table of the room.XYFNKWIt was clear that something happened to Tom Tom, but there was no sight.of the old man.XYFNKWDillon didn’t have time to think more about it as he heard the creature behind him again and just knew that it was coming for him without mercy.XYFNKWHe went further into the room in search of the back door he knew was there.XYFNKWHe had seen the door when he first pulled up to the center on his bike earlier and was determined to escape through it.XYFNKWHe glanced back and saw the creature coming into the room just as he dove behind the overturned table.XYFNKWHe landed hard on his back which winded him a little, but he shook that off, knowing that he had bigger problems to worry about at the moment..Dillon heard boxes being thrown around and a low growl as the creature was.trying to pin point his location.XYFNKWHe rolled over, got to his knees, and peeked his head out a little.XYFNKWHe saw the back end of the coyote slip behind some boxes at the far end of the room.XYFNKWHe knew he had to make a run for it, but his one leg shook.so bad from the sheer fright of the situation that he didn’t think he could make it..He grabbed it with his hand and tried to calm himself down by breathing deeply.a couple of times.XYFNKWThe rattling of the boxes was getting more feint which Dillon took as a sign that the coyote was further away now.XYFNKWSlowly he stood and tip-toed toward where he figured the back door was.XYFNKWHe made it around some more.boxes and racks and saw the door about ten feet away.XYFNKWAs he got closer he suddenly heard a rustling sound as boxes and other items were being pushed out.of the way.XYFNKWHe looked to the left and could see items being thrown aside and could tell that the coyote was quickly closing in on him.XYFNKWHe knew he had to make a run for it..Dillon lunged for the door.XYFNKWHe turned the handle but found that it was locked!XYFNKWHe could hear the beast getting closer.XYFNKWHe fumbled around with the handle and managed to somehow get it unlocked.XYFNKWIt still wouldn’t open though..In his panic he didn’t notice that it was also dead-bolted!XYFNKWHe finally saw it and turned the bolt and began swinging the door open as quickly as he could.XYFNKWJust as he was about to jump out the creature slammed into the door full-force.XYFNKWIt slammed shut.XYFNKWThe coyote lunged at Dillon.XYFNKWBy pure instinct he shot out his leg.and kicked the thing as hard as he could in the head.XYFNKWThe creature spun backwards and landed hard on the floor.XYFNKWDillon knew that this was his only chance.XYFNKWHe pulled the door open again and ran outside.XYFNKWWhen he got out he turned and grabbed the handle.XYFNKWHe pulled on the door as hard as he could..Suddenly the coyote’s head emerged from the bottom portion of the door.XYFNKWDillon.slammed its ugly head in the jamb.XYFNKWIt didn’t even yelp, but continued to snap and growl, spraying acidic saliva all over the place.XYFNKWThankfully none of it landed on Dillon..Dillon screamed.XYFNKWHe had to resist the urge to let go of the door with all his.might.XYFNKWHe knew if he did this fight would be over.XYFNKWHe looked around frantically.for something he could use to push the creature back inside.XYFNKWThere was nothing..Then he had an idea.XYFNKWHe let one hand go of the door handle and quickly reached.over and unclipped his backpack.XYFNKWHe then slipped it off his other arm, grabbed.the strap tightly and began levelling it on the head of the creature.XYFNKWBlow after blow after blow came raining down on the monster.XYFNKWDillon didn’t know if the beast could feel any pain but eventually it retracted its head enough so that he was able to open the door slightly and slam it down on the creatures snout as hard as he could.XYFNKWIt finally made a yelping sound and pulled back into the room..Dillon slammed the door tightly..He fell back, exhausted from the encounter.XYFNKWHe tried to catch his breath..Then he heard it: distant howls coming somewhere in the desert.XYFNKWHis heart skipped and his face went pale again.XYFNKWAfter taking a moment to digest what was.potentially about to happen he leaped to his feet, clipped his backpack on, and ran to his bike.XYFNKWHe slipped his helmet on and was off as quick as he could, back the way he had come.XYFNKWThe howls were getting closer.XYFNKWHe turned his head to look.back as he entered the trail and could see something coming toward him in the distance.XYFNKWThen another object caught his attention out of the corner of his eye..He couldn’t make out what was coming toward him as the desert trail was constantly moving up and down along the landscape, but he had a pretty good—.terrifying—idea.XYFNKWHe silently berated himself for not taking the highway instead..At least he would have been able to see these things coming, and maybe even get.help from a passing car.XYFNKWNo.XYFNKWUnfortunately he was now committed to the trail..He couldn’t turn back now..He pumped his legs down on the pedals as fast as he could.XYFNKWHe got so much.speed that he started getting some decent air off the peaks of each rise.XYFNKWDust flew out behind him.XYFNKWThe path wound, dipped, and turned.XYFNKWHe went into a slight dip.and then came up fast to the top of a peak.XYFNKWHis bike caught at least five feet of air.XYFNKWIn mid jump, movement caught his eye to the right.XYFNKWHe looked over to see another one of those beasts leaping for him from a hill.XYFNKWBy instinct Dillon shot his foot out and clipped the creature in the side.XYFNKWIt went down and Dillon sped on.XYFNKWHe knew somehow that he wasn’t going to be able to outrun these things so.he decided that it was going to come down to outmaneuvering them.XYFNKWIt was at this point that he got really appreciative of his parents for insisting that he be signed up for BMX racing.XYFNKWHe knew that of all the bike races he had been in this was now his most important.XYFNKWHe was racing for his life!The creature he hit out of the air didn’t stay down long as it bounced off the.ground, rolled up on its feet, and continued the chase.XYFNKWDillon drifted around a dusty corner and another coyote leaped at him from an adjacent hill.XYFNKWHe barely.managed to duck out of the way.XYFNKWHe could hear a slight sizzling sound and knew.that the creature had dripped some of its acidic saliva onto his helmet..He went over the next rise and, by sheer luck, he clipped a third coyote in the.face with his front tire.XYFNKWAs it hit the tire it spun around a couple of times before it crashed into the ground.XYFNKWThat last blow almost threw Dillon from his bike.XYFNKWIt took all his skill to land after that hit.XYFNKWThankfully there didn’t appear to be any damage that he could note as he hit the ground and sped on..Dillon swooped into a low valley that twisted and turned.XYFNKWHe sucked in his.breath as he went around every corner, expecting to see another creature lunging.at him.XYFNKWThe sound of the howls of the beasts made Dillon’s heart pump faster.XYFNKWIt was a gross sound.XYFNKWNot like the smooth long howl you would hear from a wolf,.but more of a yelping and yipping howl, almost akin to that of a hyena or even.screaming children.XYFNKWIt was terrifying!XYFNKWThe worst part was that, because of the extremely uneven lay of the land, the yelps sometimes seemed far away while at.other times they sounded as though they were right on top of him..Dillon tried to shrug the unpleasant sounds away and just focus on speeding.through these badlands as fast as he could.XYFNKWHe hit a fairly long straight stretch in the low area he was ripping through and glanced back.XYFNKWHe could see two of the.coyotes come over opposite rises and into the valley in full pursuit.XYFNKWThey didn’t seem to be tiring and they were coming on fast.XYFNKWThe most disturbing thing was.that Dillon had no idea where the third one was.XYFNKWHe turned his attention back in front of himself again and pumped his legs down on the pedals as fast as he could, but he knew he couldn’t keep it up for much longer.XYFNKWThe straight stretch.finally veered to the right and climbed back up.XYFNKWHe used all his dexterity to barely miss a massive boulder that just seemed to appear in the middle of the trail as he went around the corner.XYFNKWHe knew that if he made one mistake and wiped out that the chase would be over.XYFNKWHe heard what sounded like gunshots in.the distance but didn’t dare stop and take a look.XYFNKWHe did manage to glance back.and noticed that the two coyotes who were in pursuit stopped for a moment and.seemed to be looking at something in the distance.XYFNKWHe counted himself lucky as.the distraction was enough for him to get a bit ahead before they turned and started the chase once more..As he got to the top of the rise he could finally see the lush green oasis lingering before him.XYFNKWIt was still a ways off, but just the sight of it gave the young boy hope that he might make it.XYFNKWThe question in Dillon’s mind, however,.was if he had enough speed and endurance to make it to the threshold before the.coyotes got him?XYFNKWAnd, if he did make it, could he survive long enough to make it to someone for help?Dillon also felt indignant to the boy who had helped him in the shop with the.bike as he said this trail was well traveled, and yet he hadn’t seen a single soul!He shook all those unpleasant thoughts from his mind and sped as fast as his legs.would drive down on the pedals..The coyotes behind him were relentless!XYFNKWAnd they were gaining on him.again..Focus Dillon, he said to himself.XYFNKWYou can do this.XYFNKWHe was almost there!XYFNKWA few more rises, a short straight stretch, and he would be there.XYFNKWHe was already.formulating a plan to be able to lose the creatures in the forest.XYFNKWHe knew that once he got out of the open areas he should be able to out manoeuvre them amongst the trees..By this time the two that were right behind him were nipping at his heels..Dillon came down from the last rise and onto the short straight stretch.XYFNKWHe just crossed the line into the oasis when he saw something emerge from the corner of.his eye.XYFNKWHe turned his head slightly to the right and saw it.XYFNKWThe third coyote!XYFNKWIt was in mid leap and he didn’t have time to react.XYFNKWIt slammed into him hard, launching him from his bike.XYFNKWThe bike rolled and tumbled onto the grass.XYFNKWDillon.hit the ground hard and rolled a number of times before coming to a stop.XYFNKWHe shook the dizziness away and quickly turned around to see the coyote a couple.of feet from him, baring its fangs and stalking forward..He looked for something he could use as a weapon, but there was nothing.XYFNKWIt.was almost to him when it suddenly stopped.XYFNKWIt stopped growling and looked confused.XYFNKWIt backed away, appearing to be in pain.XYFNKWIt started issuing whimpers as smoke began coming from its paws.XYFNKWIt turned to flee but couldn’t as its legs burst into flames, then the rest of the creature went up in a fiery inferno like an incredibly dry tree that had a match thrown on it.XYFNKWThe screams it made were horrific!XYFNKWDillon scrambled away from the dying beast and cupped his ears to block out the sound.XYFNKWIn a matter of seconds it was over and all that was left of the beast was a pile of smouldering ash..Dillon looked from the pile of ash to the other two coyotes that were at the.edge of the Oasis.XYFNKWThey paced back and forth, frothing acidic saliva, but not daring to enter the lush grounds.XYFNKWAfter a moment they both turned and ran off into the desert..Dillon was dumbfounded, not knowing what to think about the events he had.just been a part of.XYFNKWHe stood up and walked over to the pile of ash and kicked it.around with his foot.XYFNKWAs he did he noticed a glint come from within the pile.XYFNKWNot wanting to touch the ash with his hands he searched around for a small branch.then used it to unearth what he saw.XYFNKWIt appeared to be a small metal chip of some sort.XYFNKWHe knew that it was no coincidence that this creature had, what appeared to be, an implant imbedded in it.XYFNKWHe scooped it up and placed it into the side pocket of his backpack.XYFNKWHe then collected his bike and started for the resort.XYFNKWHe knew he needed to tell someone about what had just happened but he didn’t know who..Who was going to believe this crazy story!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWAnd what of Tom Tom?XYFNKWHe knew he had to go back.XYFNKWHe knew he had to go back right away....13.S T A R T L I N G D I S C O V E R Y.Dillon raced to the bike shop in order to return the rental.XYFNKWThe whole.way over, he kept reminding himself to be cool, but the excitement of.the situation wouldn’t allow for that.XYFNKWHe had to dance around why the.bike was a little more scratched than it was when he picked it up, but Tara, the same woman who rented it to him didn’t seem overly concerned about it.XYFNKWWhat.she did seem concerned about was how much of a hurry Dillon seemed to be in..He knew he would definitely have to do better when he asked Dad to take him to.the information center..Dillon brushed off his anxiousness as him having to go to the restroom real.bad.XYFNKWThe story seemed to work as she didn’t press him on it anymore..Thanks for the ride, he said as he hoisted his backpack over his shoulder.and headed for the door..No problem, the lady replied.XYFNKWNext time, try and be more careful.XYFNKWA bike.can be replaced, but we wouldn’t want you getting hurt.XYFNKWThat could ruin your vacation..Dillon paused at the door and glanced back at the woman, the seriousness of.his situation crashing down on him.XYFNKWYou’re right about that, he agreed soberly..He was about to leave when he noticed the lights flickered in the store and.then went out.XYFNKWAnother black out?XYFNKWDillon asked..Tara just smiled and nodded.XYFNKWWe’re in the process of upgrading our.electrical system.XYFNKWWhen that’s done, these should be a thing of the past....The lights flickered and came to life again as Dillon nodded to the woman and exited the shop..AFTER HE WAS GONE, TARA STARED AT HIS HELMET AS SHE RAN HER HANDS OVER.the small acid burns that were there.XYFNKWShe put the scarred equipment down on the.counter and reached for the phone..HELLO, BRUCE SAID AS HE ANSWERED HIS PHONE.XYFNKWHEY DILLON!XYFNKWHOW ARE.you?XYFNKWhe asked as he continued walking toward the pool with his towel slung over his shoulder.XYFNKWGwen was close beside him.XYFNKWYa … we’re just heading to the.pool.XYFNKWIt’s too bad you didn’t come to town with us.XYFNKWWe saw tons of cool stuff!Even Claire had a good time if you can believe that?Gwen looked up at Dad and giggled at the comment..What have you been up to?XYFNKWI assumed you and Jordan were hanging by the.pool.XYFNKWHe listened as Dillon responded.XYFNKWOh … you went for a bike ride.XYFNKWNice!XYFNKWI.hope you saw lots of cool scenery!XYFNKWAnd no, I won’t tell your Mom that you split.from Jordan.XYFNKWYou know what she’s like … a little overprotective.XYFNKWHe looked down at Gwen and smiled.XYFNKWOkay man.XYFNKWIf you want to join us we’ll be pool side.by the outdoor patio.XYFNKWMom is grabbing us some shade under one of the umbrellas.there.XYFNKWHe paused again as Dillon responded.XYFNKWSee you in a bit then, he finished, sliding his phone back into his pocket..It sounds like your brother had a good time on a bike ride, he said to Gwen.XYFNKWMaybe we should all consider doing that?XYFNKWA big family bike ride..Gwen smiled and nodded..DILLON RACED TO HIS ROOM AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD.XYFNKWHE WANTED TO DROP OFF.his backpack and do a quick check of his appearance before going to see Dad..He didn’t want to raise any suspicions that his activities while away from the family were anything but normal.XYFNKWIt also gave him a chance to wind down after.the encounter.XYFNKWHe knew he had to play this smart and cool.XYFNKWHe had to get back to the information center and he knew that if he told Dad the truth about what happened he would never believe him.XYFNKWIf, on the other hand, he could show him.the signs of struggle in the center, and the absence of Tom Tom, then that would elevate his chances of getting help to another level..After changing his shirt and wiping the dust from his face and arms he headed for the pool.XYFNKWHe knew he had to play this cool and smart.XYFNKWHe could have.asked Dad over the phone to take him to the center, but he knew that Dad always.responded better to such requests in person.XYFNKWThat brought a challenge, as he wasn’t sure he was going to be able to act normally enough to convince him that.nothing was wrong.XYFNKWIt was a gamble, but he had to try..As he entered the pool area he did a quick scan and saw his family hanging.out under an umbrella by the patio just as Dad said.XYFNKWOf course Jordan was off to the side talking to some girls he had probably just met.XYFNKWClaire was in the open sun apparently trying to bake herself into a nice golden toasty color, and Gwen.was floating in the pool nearby on a massive inflatable swan.XYFNKWMom and Dad were under the umbrella having a cool drink and talking..As he started to walk over he noticed a guy at the other end of the pool lounging back in a deck chair and staring in his direction.XYFNKWThe guy had massive.wild blonde hair that danced wildly in the slightest breeze, and he was wearing a colorful Hawaiian t-shirt.XYFNKWDillon almost laughed because he looked so strange, but then he suddenly got an uncomfortable feeling from him for some reason.XYFNKWIt.was weird.XYFNKWHe knew he could get sidetracked with uncomfortable feelings and just shook it off as nerves.XYFNKWHe cleared his mind and tried to focus on the current situation: getting Dad to the center..Dillon took a couple of deep breaths in order to calm his nerves and began.walking over to them.XYFNKWAs he approached, Mom and Dad both looked up, smiling..How’s it going little man?XYFNKWMom asked..Not bad, Dillon responded, trying to be as cool as possible.XYFNKWHow was.town?It was fun!XYFNKWMom said enthusiastically.XYFNKWWe saw the residential areas..Found out that they have a tropical zoo, there’s a small amusement park on the.other side of the Oasis, and tons of little touristy shops with locals selling their wares.XYFNKWYou should have come!XYFNKWYou would have loved it!Sounds great.XYFNKWDillon tried as hard as he could to sound excited.XYFNKWHe wasn’t.sure his performance was cutting it..What’s up man?XYFNKWDad asked.XYFNKWYou seem like something is bothering you?That’s it!XYFNKWDillon figured he was done at that point.XYFNKWCome on man!XYFNKWGet it together!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWNothing’s wrong, he responded quickly.XYFNKWThen he had an idea.XYFNKWI saw some cool plants around here that I didn’t recognize and I really want to go pick up a book on the local plant life.XYFNKWI think I saw one at the information center..I guess I should be happy that one of our sons is interested in expanding his mind, Dad replied sarcastically as he smirked at Jordan who just walked back.from talking to his new friends.XYFNKWBut since when have you been into plants?Oh, you know me.XYFNKWI love reading everything about different places, Dillon.replied with a shrug.XYFNKWSo … I guess I came to ask you if we could take a quick.drive to the information center so I could grab that book?Dad visibly sighed a bit.XYFNKWWe just got to the pool Dillon.XYFNKWDoes it have to be.right now?It’s not that far up the road, Dillon put in urgently.XYFNKWHe realized it sounded.too insistent so he said more calmly, It won’t take long.XYFNKWI don’t know what time the center closes, and it would be a great book to read while I enjoy the sun with you guys pool side..Mom gave Dad that look, and Dillon knew he had him!Okay, replied Dad resignedly.XYFNKWLet me grab my keys from the room..Thanks Dad!XYFNKWDillon exclaimed..Dad nodded, removed himself from the chair and headed for his room..Mom smiled.XYFNKWYou boys have fun..Dillon nodded and smiled, but on the inside he was terrified.XYFNKWWhat if he was.putting his Dad in danger by taking him there?XYFNKWHe put the disturbing thought..away.XYFNKWHe didn’t know what else to do and besides, he had escaped the coyotes.once before by himself, it should be a breeze with his Dad with him..THEY PULLED UP TO THE CENTER AND EVERYTHING APPEARED NORMAL AT FIRST.glance.XYFNKWThere were even a few more cars in the parking lot.XYFNKWDillon was surprised by this given the fact that only just over an hour had elapsed since he made his escape from the place.XYFNKWHe didn’t let the apparent normalcy of the situation deter him from being on guard though.XYFNKWHe and Dad approached the front door together.but Dillon reached for the handle first, not willing to let his unsuspecting father go in first without any idea of the situation they faced.XYFNKWDillon figured that he could better respond to anything that came leaping out of there..He opened the door quickly and launched himself into the center..Whoa there!XYFNKWDad exclaimed.XYFNKWYou really must want that book, he joked..Dillon didn’t smile..He looked around and noticed that the place didn’t seem touched at all!There were no signs of struggle and there were even a few people mingling around, looking at merchandise.XYFNKWAs he moved through the store he noted that the.one thing that was absent was Charlie, the stuffed coyote that had frightened Gwen when they first arrived.XYFNKWHe didn’t know what to think.XYFNKWWas Charlie the coyote that attacked me?XYFNKWWas he somehow in stasis before?XYFNKWNone of it made sense..So how long did you have to wait in that traffic delay this morning on the.highway, he overheard someone say as he moved over to where he had the battle with the first coyote.XYFNKWHe paused for a moment to consider that..Maybe that’s why no one was around when Tom Tom was questioned?XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWBut who would do that?XYFNKWHe shook his head in confusion..Again, he had more questions than answers.XYFNKWFirst the missing stuffed coyote and.now this..When he got to the place where the coyote was he noticed that all of the racks of clothing were neatly placed and there seemed to be no sign of anything..He climbed under one of the racks to look around..Dillon, what are you doing?XYFNKWDad asked as he approached..Oh … nothing Dad, Dillon responded from under the rack.XYFNKWI just.remembered that I think I might have dropped something around here the last time we were through.XYFNKWHe stuck his head out from behind some T-shirts, It just sort of hit me when we walked in..Dad looked at him quizzically..His head disappeared behind the shirts again..Can I help you with something?Dad turned his head and saw a young woman approaching.XYFNKWShe was thin, had.dark brown hair, olive skin, and a nice smile.XYFNKWI don’t think so, Dad replied..My son here thinks he might have lost something the last time we were here..Dillon could hear the conversation and knew that he had to exit the clothing.rack so he wouldn’t draw anymore suspicion.XYFNKWBefore he did he noticed.something on the floor underneath the rack.XYFNKWHe quickly pulled out his phone and.turned on the flashlight in order to get a better look.XYFNKWHe rubbed his hand on the surface of the floor and noticed that it had marks that appeared to be burned into the floor.XYFNKWThe acid drool!XYFNKWHe whispered to himself.XYFNKWHe knew then that this was an elaborate coverup.XYFNKWHe snapped a quick picture..No, he said finally as he pulled himself from the floor.XYFNKWIt’s not here..What’s not there?XYFNKWDad asked..Oh nothing … nothing important anyway..Well if there’s anything you need just ask, said the young woman..Actually … Dillon began, I was just wondering where Tom Tom is.today?The woman looked at Dillon for a moment.XYFNKWHe tried to detect if there was any obvious hesitation or clue in her look that gave him any indication that she knew the truth about Tom Tom.XYFNKWHer look told him nothing.XYFNKWHe’s not here today, she responded..Where is he?XYFNKWDillon pressed..I believe he called in sick.XYFNKWAt least that’s what I gathered from my boss..And who might that be?XYFNKWDillon asked..Dillon!XYFNKWDad reprimanded.XYFNKWI don’t think that’s any of your business.XYFNKWNow let’s get the book you were looking for and get out of here.XYFNKWDad turned to the.woman, I’m sorry, he said.XYFNKWMy son is sometimes too curious for his own good.XYFNKWHe looked disapprovingly at Dillon..It’s okay, the young woman replied and smiled at the both of them before.heading back to the counter..Dillon sheepishly offered Dad a disarming smile then scurried off to the book section before Dad could say another word to him..This is weird.XYFNKWHe thought to himself.XYFNKWHow could they get this place in order and opened again so quickly?XYFNKWThey even have a replacement for Tom Tom!XYFNKWThese guys (whoever they are) are good..Dillon was now convinced more than ever that he had to figure out this conspiracy.XYFNKWHe knew he had to find out what had happened to Tom Tom, and he.knew he had to find out what those creatures were that he escaped from.XYFNKWMaybe.there was a clue to that in the book on desert animals that Tom Tom suggested he buy?He went over to the book section and lingered around for a minute, all-the-.while looking around trying to gauge a good opportunity to sneak away for a minute.XYFNKWHe knew he had to get to that back room..He peeked his head up over the shelf and noticed that Dad was at the far end.of the center looking at a rack of brochures.XYFNKWHe glanced to the left and right quickly and then ducked back down and snuck around the shelf.XYFNKWHe weaved through the rows keeping his head lower than the racks, hoping that no one would be able to detect him..He got to the back wall and creeped along it, stopping twice to quickly dodge.behind some shelves in order to avoid another customer.XYFNKWHe approached the corner that intersected with the hallway which led to the back room.XYFNKWHe was about to slip around it when he felt someone tap his shoulder.XYFNKWHe leaped around.and made a short cry as the tap startled him!XYFNKWThere, looking him in the face, was a small boy about five years of age.XYFNKWHe stared at Dillon with his bright blue eyes..Whatcha doing?XYFNKWhe asked innocently..What am I doing?XYFNKWDillon whispered back in an exasperated tone.XYFNKWTrying.not to die of fright because of you!The boy was about to say something else but Dillon put up his finger..Shhhh, he said quietly.XYFNKWIf you must know I’m a private investigator on a mission to crack a mystery..The boy looked at him blankly..Like agent Cody Banks … Spy Kids … Dillon tried to explain..The boy looked blankly..Right … that’s before your time, he replied.XYFNKWAnyway … I need to get down this hallway without being seen, and I can’t have anyone know about my.mission..The boy nodded..So … you can’t tell anyone that you met me.XYFNKWUnderstand?The boy nodded again..No one, Dillon reinforced.XYFNKWOr I’m a dead man, he said while pulling his.finger across his throat dramatically in order to emphasize his point..The boy’s eyes went wide!You don’t want me to die?XYFNKWDo you?The boy shook his head vigorously back and forth..Great!XYFNKWNow go and play and don’t mention a word of this to anyone,.Dillon said as he turned his head back around the corner in order to take another peek.XYFNKWHe quickly looked back and saw the boy standing there.XYFNKWHe motioned with.his hand for him to leave.XYFNKWThe boy, still seemingly in shock about Dillon’s statement of possible death, turned and ran back toward the front of the store..Kids!XYFNKWDillon whispered to himself in exasperation as he shook head..He did one more quick check to see if the coast was clear and then darted down the hallway.XYFNKWHe made it to the end, grasped the door handle, opened it up,.and slipped inside.XYFNKWThe sight he saw shocked him!XYFNKWThis room was in total disarray the last time he was here, merely an hour earlier and yet it was completely put back together.XYFNKWHe walked around a little, wearily looking about and readying for an attack from a coyote, but none came.XYFNKWHe quickly glanced around a few boxes.XYFNKWNothing.XYFNKWHe noted that the table was in exactly the location it was when he had his talk with Tom Tom and that there were no signs of a.struggle.XYFNKWHe ran to the back door and noted that it was locked once again..This is weird!XYFNKWHe thought again to himself..Before turning to leave he did notice more of the burn marks on the floor where the beast had drooled while it attacked him.XYFNKWI’m not crazy!XYFNKWHe reaffirmed to himself pulling his phone out and taking a picture of the marred floor..As he opened the door to leave he ran right into someone who was coming.into the room.XYFNKWIt was Troy!XYFNKW‘The Gate Keeper.’.Hey man, Troy said, trying to collect himself from the shock of seeing Dillon there.XYFNKWWhat are you doing back here?XYFNKWhe asked in amazement, clearly.not expecting to see him..Dillon was stunned for a moment, I … ah … was just looking for the restroom.XYFNKWI obviously took the wrong way..Troy smiled.XYFNKWNo problem, he said.XYFNKWIt’s just down the hallway to your left..Dillon smiled weakly.XYFNKWWhat are you doing here?XYFNKWHe dared to asked..Me?XYFNKWOh lots of us at the resort have to do double, triple, quadruple duties.around the place.XYFNKWI was asked to come and count inventory today, he replied with his bright, infectious, smile..Dillon nodded and slipped by the man..Bye Dillon!XYFNKWhe heard Troy call after him.XYFNKWHe turned slightly and offered a.small wave, trying not to appear too guilty of having snooped around.XYFNKWHe knew.in his head that he wasn’t very convincing..As soon as Dillon exited the hallway he grabbed his Dad and told him it was.time to go..Did you get your book?XYFNKWDad asked..No … it … ah … wasn’t in.XYFNKWThey must have sold all the copies..Dad shrugged and headed for the door with his son..Dillon silently berated himself for not actually going to the restroom after he.was caught by Troy.XYFNKWHe felt that he really wasn’t good at this whole thinking on his feet sort of thing.XYFNKWHe knew he would need to get better at it if he wanted to crack the case without drawing suspicion to himself.XYFNKWSarah’s words of warning rang out again in his mind: You have to promise me that you won’t do anything.stupid like going to look for this entrance.XYFNKWHe just pushed her words aside...There’s too much going on here, he said to himself..Before leaving the center he glanced back and surveyed the room that he barely escaped merely an hour ago.XYFNKWIt was too surreal!XYFNKWHe knew he needed to get.help, but he also knew that no one would believe him.XYFNKWThe only one who would.believe him is Sarah, but he really didn’t want to have a verbal reprimand from.her right now.XYFNKWNo one else around here would be remotely accepting of his circumstance except maybe one person.XYFNKWIt was a long shot.XYFNKWA really long shot..But he knew he had to try..JORDAN WAS ENJOYING THIS PLACE!XYFNKWIT HAD EVERYTHING HE NEEDED: LOTS OF.sun, a great pool, cute girls his age, and all you could eat.XYFNKWHe wasn’t even concerned about not being able to game while at the resort which was incredibly.shocking, even for him!XYFNKWHe lounged back in his chair that was poolside, soaking.up the rays, and sucking back on his virgin margarita.XYFNKWThis was the life!Hey man, he heard as Dillon approached with Dad.XYFNKWEnjoying yourself?Dillon asked..Oh ya, came Jordan’s response.XYFNKWYou should try it on the other side of the.pool.XYFNKWAway from me.XYFNKWThere’s nothing like it..Dillon shrugged off the sleight and sat down beside him looking around, trying not to appear too anxious.XYFNKWHe noted that Mom and Gwen were out in the.pool and that Dad was getting ready to join them.XYFNKWNot too far from Jordan was.Claire who was reclining on her chair and appeared to be in a coma.XYFNKWShe had always been a deep sleeper which Dillon knew would work to his advantage..What’s up man?XYFNKWasked Jordan, his eyes still closed and a slight smile on his face.XYFNKWHe appeared to be in total relax mode..Oh nothing, Dillon replied, pausing until Dad was no longer in earshot..Okay man, Dillon suddenly said as he leaned closer to his brother.XYFNKWSomething.really creepy is going on here!XYFNKWHe whispered as loud as he dared..The suddenness of Dillon’s response startled Jordan.XYFNKWHe looked over at him.skeptically.XYFNKWWhat are you talking about goof?XYFNKWhe responded...Dillon leaned in further and explained the whole thing, constantly looking around to see if anyone was watching.XYFNKWJordan seemed to listen.XYFNKWAt times, however, he would snort or scoff a little, especially when Dillon tried to explain the coyote incident.XYFNKWDillon continued anyway.XYFNKWWhen he was done Jordan stared.at him for a moment, then a huge smile spread across his face..Nice try Dillon, he said with a chuckle.XYFNKWInteresting story.XYFNKWToo bad it’s all.in your head.XYFNKWI’ve always said that you have a pretty awesome imagination.XYFNKWThis.one is one of your better ones.XYFNKWHe put his head back down and closed his eyes.again..I’m not imagining things!XYFNKWDillon replied, his voice rising a little louder than he wanted.XYFNKWClaire stirred a bit in her chair.XYFNKWThere’s something going on here and we need to figure out what it is..Uh huh, was the only response he received from his brother..I have proof!XYFNKWDillon exclaimed, pulling out his phone.XYFNKWLook at these pictures..That caught Jordan’s attention..These are spots on the floor at the information center where the thing drooled acidic saliva.XYFNKWAnd this … he looked around cautiously as he showed Jordan the small burn that was on his hand..Jordan pulled his sunglasses off in order to get a better look.XYFNKWThen he laughed.and sat back on the chair, dismissing the evidence with a wave.XYFNKWGood one Dil.XYFNKWYou almost had me..Dillon’s face went red.XYFNKWAhhhh … Why did I even try to talk to you about this?XYFNKWhe said in exasperation as he got up from his chair..Have fun on your little adventure, he heard Jordan say as he stormed away..DILLON LAID IN BED FLIPPING THROUGH THE BOOK ON JOHN TAYLOR SEBASTIAN..He could hear Jordan’s snores lightly in the background.XYFNKWAs he flipped through.he was drawn to the pictures and spent a long time looking at them.XYFNKWHe would.have loved to have gotten to meet John and his crew.XYFNKWHe flipped the page and.noted the picture that had John alone leaning down unearthing a find he had discovered on one of his previous digs.XYFNKWThe man looked so focussed on what he.was doing.XYFNKWAs Dillon looked closer something caught his eye.XYFNKWThere was something hanging from his belt but he couldn’t quite make it out.XYFNKWHe quickly grabbed his phone, switched on the camera, pointed it at the picture and zoomed.in.XYFNKWEven though the picture was terribly pixilated he just knew what it was and.almost fell over!XYFNKWHe quickly grabbed his backpack and rummaged through it until he found … the watch!XYFNKWHe flipped the watch over and stared in disbelief at the writing that was on the back: JTS!XYFNKWJohn Taylor Sebastian!XYFNKWThis actually was.his watch!How could this be?XYFNKWDillon whispered to himself..Then it struck him!XYFNKWSomeone wanted him to come here.XYFNKWSomeone somehow.planted this watch for him to find.XYFNKWThe hairs on the back of his neck stood up..Dillon’s heart pounded furiously in his chest with the revelation that someone, for whatever reason, lured Dillon and his family here..But who?XYFNKWAnd why?..14.D I L L O N A N D D E R E K.Dillon looked around nervously.XYFNKWEverything was dark except for the.light glow of something that was emanating off the wall.XYFNKWIt was.enough to be able to make out shapes but it didn’t produce enough.light to manage the tunnels safely.XYFNKWHe reached in his pocket and pulled out his phone.XYFNKWThe screen seemed dim.XYFNKWHe noticed that there were no bars of service..Quickly he scrolled the screen upwards and pushed on the flashlight function..The light came on for a moment, then began to dim.XYFNKWHe noticed that the battery.indicator on the home screen was slowly being depleting.XYFNKWHe knew he had charged the phone before leaving his room which made him realize now that something must be causing a disturbance with his electronics.XYFNKWBut what?He tried to control his breathing as the seconds ticked by as he thought about.his predicament.XYFNKWHis eyes went to the tunnel wall as he shined the dimming light of his phone upon its surface.XYFNKWThere on the wall he could clearly make out the symbol of the eye in the pentagram surrounded by the square.XYFNKWHis heart began to.pound and he felt as though it would leap out of his chest at any moment.XYFNKWDillon closed his eyes as he tried to get a hold of his wild imagination.XYFNKWHe could feel the cold sweat of his palms and the only thing he could hear was the sound of his own breathing..He opened his eyes and stared at the symbol as the light waned.XYFNKWThe symbol.faded from his sight as his phone went dead leaving him in the dark...DILLON WOKE WITH A CHILL.XYFNKWHE LOOKED AROUND GROGGILY AND NOTICED THAT.he was in his hotel room.XYFNKWThe sheets of his bed were scattered everywhere as though he had a fight with some unseen monster.XYFNKWHe looked over to see his brother snoozing soundly without a care in the world..I wish, he whispered to himself as he pulled his tired body from bed and.headed to the restroom.XYFNKWEvery time he had one of these weird dreams he felt as.though he was hit by a truck when he woke up.XYFNKWIt wasn’t the most restful of sleeps..After splashing some water on his face he jumped into the shower.XYFNKWHe couldn’t get the dream out of his head..What could it mean?XYFNKWhe asked himself.XYFNKWObviously there is some reality to it, he reasoned as he knew that he first saw the symbol in a dream before he even.saw it in the real world..How is that even possible?XYFNKWhe questioned himself as he scrubbed his hair thoroughly..Do these dreams mean that the things I see in them are going to happen?That thought sent a chill up his spine as he remembered the dream where he and.Gwen jumped off that cliff in order to flee from those spider-like creatures.XYFNKWHe shook his head in disbelief.XYFNKWNo, he reasoned.XYFNKWThey can’t be that detailed.XYFNKWCan they?After he finished getting ready he called his Mom on her phone and asked where and when they were having breakfast.XYFNKWWhile he spoke to her he couldn’t.get the dreams out of his head.XYFNKWHe seriously considered telling her what was happening to him, but he didn’t even know where to start with a conversation like that.XYFNKWBy the way Mom, I’m having these dreams that I think might actually come true!XYFNKWYa that would sound normal, he thought to himself..He shook off those thoughts.XYFNKWI don’t think Jordan is going to make it, he said into the phone as he glanced over at his nearly-in-a-coma brother.XYFNKWI’ll see you guys in a minute then, he finished as he hung up..Well bro … see ya whenever you wake up.XYFNKWJordan grumbled something..and rolled over.XYFNKWDillon seriously considered waking him up as he wasn’t keen on.being by himself right now, even just walking to breakfast.XYFNKWHe knew something.was happening here something he was now a part of, whether he liked to be or.not.XYFNKWAnd it was really creeping him out..HE AND THE REST OF HIS FAMILY HAD A GREAT BREAKFAST.XYFNKWIT ALMOST MADE.Dillon forget about all the troubling events that had happened to him since he got to the resort except for the fact that he couldn’t get it all out of his head..It must have been noticeable on his face as Mom looked over and asked,.Are you okay honey?XYFNKWYou look tired..What … oh … I’m okay, he stammered.XYFNKWI just didn’t get much sleep last.night..In truth he didn’t feel okay with the events he was caught up in.XYFNKWHe didn’t know which way to go.XYFNKWHe knew he couldn’t confide in anyone as no one would.believe him.XYFNKWHe also knew that there seemed to be powerful forces behind the disappearances of John Taylor Sebastian and now Tom Tom which was.evidenced by the speed at which the information center was cleaned up after his.encounter with the coyotes.XYFNKWAnd who was that mysterious man who was talking.with Tom Tom?XYFNKWDillon knew he probably hadn’t heard the last of him.XYFNKWThe question he had, however, was what role he played in the disappearance of Tom.Tom if any?XYFNKWIt seemed weird that the mystery man would just leave and then come back to take the old man away when he had a perfectly good opportunity.to do just that when it was just the two of them at the center.XYFNKWThat man also didn’t have time to come back and abduct Tom Tom as Dillon was still there fighting the coyote when he disappeared.XYFNKWAnd the way he spoke about John seemed to suggest that he wanted to find him which indicated that there were probably two groups of people at play here..If that was the case then who was the other group?XYFNKWAnd were they the ones.who sent the coyotes?XYFNKWWhere did they even get coyotes like that anyway?XYFNKWAnd.were the coyotes meant for Tom Tom or for him?XYFNKWThat last thought troubled him.the most.XYFNKWThe events seemed to suggest just that.XYFNKWThe coyote in the center might have been meant for Tom Tom but not the ones in the desert.XYFNKWThose were definitely gunning for him!XYFNKWThere’s no other reasonable explanation for it..Finally Dillon decided that he would take it easy for a bit with his family, but not let his guard down.XYFNKWHe determined to stay with at least one member from his.family, if possible, and keep in plain view of others just in case the unknown assailants sent something else his way.XYFNKWHe felt that this would be the safest course.XYFNKWMaybe some other piece of evidence would surface in the meantime?As they were just finishing up their delicious breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast,.fresh fruit, and the like Jordan stumbled their way.XYFNKWHe looked rough!Tough night son?XYFNKWDad asked as he approached..Jordan grumbled..Gwen laughed..Well … when you’re done I think we’re all just going to lounge at the pool.for a bit and then maybe head into town and check out that amusement park,.Mom stated.XYFNKWYou wanna come?Jordan nodded..Man of few words, Dad said as he laughed and went in for some more bacon..After breakfast Dillon headed back to his room in order to get his swim gear..He was still hesitant to walk there alone, but he figured he would be safe in the midst of a crowded resort.XYFNKWBesides, he knew Jordan would be along momentarily.which calmed him a bit..As the elevator door closed he heard the distinctive chime of his phone go off that indicated he was receiving a text.XYFNKWHe pulled his phone out and looked at the screen.XYFNKWThe blood drained from his face..We know what you’ve been up to, the message said.XYFNKWDillon felt his knees.go weak.XYFNKWThen the phone rang and he felt the elevator suddenly stopped, but the.door didn’t open.XYFNKWThe phone rang and rang as he pushed the open door button..Nothing.XYFNKWAll the phone said was, Unknown Caller..He let it ring until his voicemail picked it up.XYFNKWSilence.XYFNKWHe could feel his heart pound in his chest and could hear his breathing.XYFNKWHe pushed the open door button.again.XYFNKWNothing.XYFNKWThen the phone rang again.XYFNKWUnknown Caller, it said again..He slid the bar on the touch screen and put the phone to his ear.XYFNKWHullo, he.said, his voice barely audible..Hi Dillon, came the reply.XYFNKWThe voice was deep and unnatural.XYFNKWIt was obviously being masked by a voice changing device.XYFNKWWe know that you’ve been.looking into things that a boy your age shouldn’t concern himself with..Dillon was silent, not knowing how to respond..Why don’t you just enjoy your vacation with your family.XYFNKWI’m sure they wouldn’t want you to get hurt.XYFNKWThere was a long pause as Dillon was too scared.to say anything.XYFNKWAnd I’m sure you wouldn’t want anything to happen to them,.would you?The elevator door suddenly opened and Dillon shrieked as a little girl about.Gwen’s age ran into the elevator with her Dad startling him.XYFNKWThe girl’s Dad actually flinched a little at Dillon’s outburst..You okay kid?XYFNKWhe asked as he carefully moved around Dillon..Dillon nodded his head rapidly as he ran out into the hallway and toward his.room.XYFNKWHe burst through the door and slammed it shut behind him..What is happening here!XYFNKWhe screamed in his head.XYFNKWHe took a few deep breaths in order to calm himself down.XYFNKWWhen he was able to think clearly again.he replayed the conversation in his mind..Okay … okay … he said aloud.XYFNKWObviously these people, whoever they.are, don’t want me snooping around.XYFNKWHe paused, deep in thought.XYFNKWWhich is probably because there is something they don’t want me to find.XYFNKWIt was weird to him, but that line of reasoning seemed to calm him down more and actually intrigued him..But what about the veiled threat?XYFNKWhe voiced.XYFNKWNow he knew he was stuck..He didn’t want anyone to get hurt, especially his family, but he had a strong desire to find out what these people were hiding..Would they actually harm a twelve year old kid?XYFNKWhe mused.XYFNKWWell if the coyotes were any indication, he said aloud as he started to pace, then I guess the answer is yes..He flopped down on his bed.XYFNKWNo, he realized.XYFNKWThe risk was too much for him..to keep going with this.XYFNKWThe man on the phone only warned him to stop which.implied that if he got out now then nothing bad would happen and he could enjoy the rest of his vacation..He grabbed the watch from his pack and looked at it, rubbing his thumb over.the initials ‘JTS.’ The one thing he couldn’t figure out is who was the one who.made sure he would find this?XYFNKWThat thought troubled him as it suggested that there was someone pushing him in this direction, but he knew now he couldn’t.go where they wanted him to.XYFNKWHe would have to give up the chase..Sorry John, he said as he put the watch back.XYFNKWI’m sure someone else is looking for you..DILLON FELT AS THOUGH A WEIGHT HAD BEEN LIFTED OFF HIS CHEST NOW THAT.he had made the decision to leave the mystery alone, and he was actually enjoying himself at the pool with his family.XYFNKWHe was still confused about the dreams he was having, but he put them out of his mind and decided to focus on.having fun and enjoy his vacation.XYFNKWAfter an hour of pool-time the Hunts boarded.the bus and headed to town.XYFNKWThe town site was actually really kind of quaint..There were nice houses scattered about and many residents were out and about.on their daily business.XYFNKWTons of tourists walked through town and into the many.shops that were splayed throughout.XYFNKWThere was one big strip in the downtown core where most of the touristy shops were.XYFNKWThe bus rolled through downtown then took another side street which led right to the amusement park..The park itself was full of rides and games.XYFNKWMuch like what you would see at.any amusement park.XYFNKWIn fact it seemed really out of place from the rest of Oasis..Most of the place was quiet and serene whereas the park was wild, loud, and entertaining.XYFNKWIt was obviously put here in order to generate more money for the.town by keeping the tourists happy.XYFNKWAnd boy did it ever attract the tourists!XYFNKWThe place was packed!At the entrance to the grounds the people who were staying at the hotel, like.the Hunts, checked in to acquire their bracelets which allowed them access to the..rides and provided a way to charge their room for the items they purchased..Dillon thought this was a really slick way of doing it..Okay, we all need to stay together Mom stated as they entered..Jordan rolled his eyes.XYFNKWA move that Mom didn’t see, but Dad saw it and got.the message.XYFNKWHe gave the boys a wink.XYFNKWI think the boys can go off on their own.if they want.XYFNKWWe can always have them do a check in text, honey..Mom paused for a moment before responding.XYFNKWWell, okay … I guess, she.conceded..You guys have fun but make sure you stay together, Dad put in, trying to.calm Mom’s hesitancy..Jordan and Dillon nodded..And give us a call if you have any problems, Mom put in..Jordan sighed.XYFNKWYou guys worry too much, he replied.XYFNKWCome on twerp, he.turned to Dillon and motioned for him to follow..THE PARK DEFINITELY EXCEEDED ALL THE BOY’S EXPECTATIONS!XYFNKWJORDAN AND.Dillon went on ride after ride, scarfed down cotton candy, ice cream, and pop, and even managed to get in a few of those carny games that most people can’t.win at.XYFNKWThe only damper to the fun was when they were riding the Ferris Wheel.and got stuck!XYFNKWThey were nearing the bottom when the power suddenly cut out..You gotta be kidding!XYFNKWthey heard one of the ride conductors exclaim in exasperation.XYFNKWThese power outages have been occurring more frequently..Someone has to fix this!His co-conductor nodded in agreement as they both busied themselves with.making sure all the switches were in the right position..As Dillon looked around he noticed that it wasn’t just their ride that was down, but that the whole park was taking a hit..Man!XYFNKWI’d hate to be those guys in the rollercoaster right now, Jordan said.with a laugh as he pointed over to where the coaster was.XYFNKWIt didn’t get enough of a boost half way through the track in order to make it through some of the twists.and turns and so some of the riders were stuck in awkward positions..Dillon nodded his agreement.XYFNKWThankfully all these outages seemed to be only.for a brief time, but he thought that it was weird that a resort this sophisticated would be having this many power problems.XYFNKWThen again, they really were literally in the middle of the desert—hundreds of miles away from any other civilization, and Tara, the bike shop lady, did mention that they were upgrading the system which should solve these problems..Hey man, you hungry?XYFNKWJordan said to Dillon after they finally were able to.exit the ride when the power came back on..Dillon looked at him in disbelief!XYFNKWAfter all that stuff we just ate you’re still hungry?XYFNKWhe scoffed..Ya, Jordan replied.XYFNKWI’m sixteen you know, he said as though that should.have explained it all.XYFNKWDon’t worry twerp, you’ll be the same way in a few years..Dillon was sceptical as he never could understand how someone Jordan’s size (which was pretty average) could put away so much food and have nothing.to show for it!Why don’t you grab a spot for us over there.XYFNKWJordan motioned to an outdoor patio area..Dillon worked his way through the crowd and found an empty table by the.railing on the edge of the area beside the walkway that led through the park.XYFNKWThis amusement park was a much needed distraction for the young boy in order to help get his mind off things.XYFNKWBut anytime he had a moment to himself his thoughts started to drift to the circumstances he had been a part of.XYFNKWAnd every time he sat down, he would feel the exhaustion of poor sleep creeping up on him.XYFNKWHe still wondered how he would be able to get help in dealing with the situation.XYFNKWHe took a deep breath and remembered that all he had to do was stay.out of it.XYFNKWEven so he was really troubled by the fact that he was almost killed and he couldn’t even tell his parents about it!XYFNKWJordan, the only one in his family who he thought might remotely believe him, except for Gwen— who would be of no.help to him—had dismissed his supposedly wild imaginary adventure.XYFNKWHe knew something strange was going on and that someone had targeted him.specifically.XYFNKWThe thought frightened him.XYFNKWHe shook his head.XYFNKWJust stay out of it, he reminded himself again..You having fun?XYFNKWcame a man’s voice.XYFNKWDillon jumped a little as he was jolted from his thoughts.XYFNKWHe looked up to see those piercing blue eyes and shaven scalp which sported the asian writing tattoo he had seen a couple days earlier in the stairway.XYFNKWIt was Derek!Oh … sorry for startling you, Derek replied with a smile.XYFNKWI just saw a friendly face and thought you could use some company..It’s … ah … okay, Dillon responded, trying to collect himself..You looked like you were deep in thought, Derek prodded.XYFNKWEverything okay?Ya … ya … I was just … just thinking about the next ride I was going to.take..You know, began Derek, you’re a terrible liar Dillon..Dillon was dumbfounded!XYFNKWHe didn’t know what to say next!XYFNKWDerek had.called him out and he was like a mouse trapped in a corner with a huge cat ready to pounce on him.XYFNKWHe was frightened.XYFNKWThen it struck him.XYFNKWThat voice!XYFNKWHe knew.that voice!XYFNKWDerek was the one who was talking to Tom Tom!Dillon squirmed, not knowing what to say next..Don’t worry Dillon, Derek finally said at length, you and I are on the same team.XYFNKWHe smiled and leaned casually on the railing, trying to disarm the kid..I … but … Dillon tried desperately to say something but it just wasn’t coming out..Don’t say anything, Derek replied.XYFNKWJust listen.XYFNKWIf you do that then a lot of.your questions will be answered.XYFNKWUnderstand?Dillon nodded..I work for a group of people called The Orion Group who were assisting John Taylor Sebastian to find something for us.XYFNKWObviously the people who have.what we need didn’t want Mr.XYFNKWSebastian to discover it.XYFNKWHe paused for effect then said, His disappearance, as I’m sure you’re aware of by now, was no accident.XYFNKWHe looked around, as though he was making sure that no one was.listening in on them.XYFNKWDillon looked around as well out of reflex..Derek turned back to Dillon.XYFNKWHis eyes almost piercing through him.XYFNKWWe were getting nowhere with our investigation and decided that your unique abilities would be useful to us..What abilities?XYFNKWDillon asked..You can find things, Dillon.XYFNKWThings no one else seems to be able to find..And, with you looking with us, we’re certain we can find what we’re looking for..I don’t want trouble, Dillon said..Unfortunately, our enemies have already noticed you poking around.XYFNKWYou need us, Dillon, just like we need you.XYFNKWThat’s why I’ve chosen to make contact..Dillon swallowed hard, trying to digest the news..They … whoever they are, have also made contact and warned me to stay.away from this..Derek look hard at him..They threatened harm to me and my family if I didn’t drop it..My employer doesn’t want to see that happen, Derek was quick to add,.and we can offer protection until this thing is over, he said, trying to reassure the young boy.XYFNKWBut we need the use of your gifts..Dillon had about a thousand questions he wanted to asked but none of them.would surface as he was still in shock by Derek’s admissions..Derek must have noticed this by the look on Dillon’s face.XYFNKWYes, he said,.we were the ones who got your family the free vacation.XYFNKWI planted the watch that you found when you were playing in the forest by your house, and I was also the one who dropped the arrow head for you to find in the gas station parking lot.XYFNKWThese are all items of John’s we managed to acquire and we are sure they’re clues to finding where he was taken, but without your help we don’t think we will be able to do this..But how did you know I was going to find them?XYFNKWDillon was able to ask..Derek smiled.XYFNKWBy all accounts It was guaranteed that you would find them.due to the gifts you possess..By whose account?XYFNKWHow do you know me?XYFNKWHow long have you been.watching me?XYFNKWWhat are these gifts you keep talking about?XYFNKWDillon blurted..Derek waved a hand in the air trying to signal for Dillon to lower his voice..I don’t have time to explain this to you.XYFNKWAll you need to do is agree to help us..We can’t do this without you..Dillon was silent.XYFNKWAgain, Sarah’s voice rang out in his head in warning, and.so did the deep-voiced man..John needs you, Derek emphasized.XYFNKWWe think he’s still alive but he might.not be for much longer if we can’t find out what happened to him.XYFNKWWhether you.choose to help us or not, you and your family are now in danger.XYFNKWThese people.won’t stop at a threat.XYFNKWAnd, as I said, if you agree to help us, we can offer you protection..That last statement removed all hesitation from Dillon and silenced Sarah and the deep-voiced man in his head.XYFNKWHe truly did want to find out what happened to John, and if he was able to do something to help save the man’s life then he would do it.XYFNKWHe just hoped that Derek’s offer of protection was enough to keep his family safe..He nodded..Great, replied Derek.XYFNKWI have to go now, but I’ll be in touch real soon.XYFNKWWe.have to act quickly.XYFNKWWith that Derek spun around and, before walking into the.crowd said, One last thing Dillon.XYFNKWDon’t tell anyone about this.XYFNKWWe don’t want.more people getting hurt.Dillon nodded as the blood drained from his face.XYFNKWThat statement of them having to act quickly relieved Dillon a little as he now knew he had some direction that he needed to pursue, and that it was going to happen soon, but the comment about getting hurt did not sit well with him.XYFNKWHe hated the idea of not knowing what to do.XYFNKWAnd he definitely wasn’t fond of the idea of getting hurt, whether it was himself or someone else..Hey man, said Jordan as he approached the table with a huge tray of food.and a drink for Dillon.XYFNKWI thought you could use this, he said as he placed the monster drink in front of his brother.XYFNKWWho was that you were talking to?XYFNKWhe asked..Who … oh him?XYFNKWDillon tried to play it cool.XYFNKWNo one.XYFNKWJust a guy I met in.the stairway at the resort.XYFNKWI guess he remembered me from a couple days ago and wanted to talk.XYFNKWDillon sucked back on his pop..Right … replied Jordan sceptically..Man!XYFNKWI am terrible at this lying thing!XYFNKWDillon lamented to himself.XYFNKWHe continued a long pull on his straw draining half his drink in a matter of seconds..Jordan stared at him for what seemed to be an eternity trying to get him to share more.XYFNKWDillon looked away pretending to be interested in something else.XYFNKWJordan.stared for another second then unwrapped his lunch and began eating..That’s pretty cool, Dillon said as he pointed to a nearby ride..Ah huh, was all Jordan said with a mouth full of food..The rest of the time that Dillon had to kill watching his brother eat his burger and avoid answering any direct questions was soooo painful!XYFNKWHe knew that Jordan didn’t believe him and he wanted to tell him the truth because maybe he.would believe him this time, but he couldn’t.XYFNKWThe last people he wanted to be harmed were members of his family—no matter how annoying they were at times.XYFNKWNo.XYFNKWHe knew he had to do this alone and trust in this stranger who had just confided in him.XYFNKWWhat other choice did he have?..15.T H E H A U N T E D H O U S E.Derek walked into the small restaurant and slipped his sunglasses off,.stowing them on his neck with the glasses facing backward.XYFNKWHe.quickly scanned the booths and noticed Jake sitting at the far table.seemingly engrossed in something he had pulled up on his tablet.XYFNKWDerek quickly.made his way over and slipped into the seat opposite Jake..Well?XYFNKWcame Jake’s immediate question without even looking away from.his screen..Derek paused for a moment before he responded.XYFNKWIt wasn’t till Jake looked up from his tablet and starred Derek in the eyes that he spoke what was on his.mind.XYFNKWI don’t like involving the boy.XYFNKWCan’t we call it off, send them away or something?XYFNKWhe stated flatly..Why the sudden change to heart?XYFNKWJake asked..Dillon has already been compromised, Derek stated.XYFNKWThey have made.contact with him and warned him not to get involved or something bad will happen to him or his family..That’s unfortunate, Jake said, rather coldly.XYFNKWBut we can’t deviate from the.plan.XYFNKWHe was involved the moment we made it so and we need to see it through..We have to bring in some more operatives to help keep the Hunts safe now..Jake nodded.XYFNKWI’ll make the call..We need them here right away, Derek stated emphatically.XYFNKWDillon is in.real danger now, and it’s only a matter of time before he disappears as well..Can I get you something?XYFNKWsaid the waitress who noticed Derek come in and sit down at the booth..Just coffee, he said as he glanced up at her..She smiled softly and padded away..You’ve made your point clear Derek, Jake continued with the conversation.after the waitress left.XYFNKWBut do you really think they would be bold enough to take a twelve year old boy from his family because he’s asking a few questions?I don’t think the resort would want that kind of publicity.XYFNKWHe almost seemed indignant at Derek’s suggestion..I know they tried to kill Dillon once with the use of the necrotoxin enhanced creatures, Derek stated.XYFNKWI caught a glimpse of Dillon speeding through the desert on his bike when I was heading back to the resort after talking with Tom Tom.XYFNKWI was pulling out of the information center parking lot and onto.the highway when I noticed a couple of the things in pursuit of him.XYFNKWDerek paused as the waitress came over with his coffee.XYFNKWWhen she was gone out of earshot he continued.XYFNKWI knew Dillon was going to be hard pressed to make it so.I tried to buy him some time by firing some shots at the creatures in order to get their attention while Dillon sped away.XYFNKWThankfully he made it..And that was lucky for us, Jake cut in..Derek’s eyes went wide..And of course lucky for the boy, Jake was quick to add, trying to pacify Derek’s shock at the cold statement.XYFNKWI don’t want any more harm to come to the.boy than you do, Jake continued.XYFNKWDerek scoffed at that remark, having had a lot of experience dealing with Jake over the years.XYFNKWBut … Jake continued, dismissing Derek’s clear sign of distrust of his statement, … we need him.XYFNKWYou.know that as much as I do.XYFNKWDillon is the key to help us save more lives..Derek sat back in silence.XYFNKWAfter a moment of digesting the information he relaxed, grabbed his coffee, and took a sip.XYFNKWHe knew Jake was right, no matter.how much he hated what they were doing to the boy.XYFNKWThe problem for him was.that he didn’t realize how dangerous this mission was going to be when they first conscripted Dillon who was, back then, totally unaware of what was going on to..him.XYFNKWNow the stakes were much higher, and he wasn’t comfortable with them..Okay then, Derek said finally.XYFNKWWhere do we go from here?Jake smiled.XYFNKWWe move to the next stage of our plan.XYFNKWWe need to get the boy.to the house..AFTER JORDAN WAS FINISHED EATING, THE TWO BROTHERS DECIDED TO EXPLORE.the other side of the park they haven’t been to yet.XYFNKWThere were dozens of more.rides over there.XYFNKWThey hit a couple of quick ones—the lines having died down during lunch—which the boys thought was awesome!XYFNKWAs they walked through trying to plan out their next adrenaline rush Jordan noticed the haunted house..Awesome!XYFNKWhe said as he ran toward it.XYFNKWDillon followed closely behind..As they approached and were about to enter, the ride operator stopped them..He was a short middle-aged man with greying hair.XYFNKWSorry boys, but you have to.go alone on this ride..What!XYFNKWWhy?XYFNKWJordan blurted..For effect of course, was the man’s reply.XYFNKWWe try to give all our guests the.best possible experience.XYFNKWAnd, obviously for a haunted house, the best experience is to scare the pants off you by yourself..Dillon’s face went pale.XYFNKWHe had enough frightful excitement so far on this trip.XYFNKWHe wasn’t sure he wanted to go seeking for it now..Oh awesome!XYFNKWJordan replied.XYFNKWThat’s a great setup.XYFNKWHe looked back at Dillon.XYFNKWHis face showed that he didn’t seem keen on the idea.XYFNKWYou’re not scared are you?XYFNKWhe chided..What … me … no, of course not, he replied, trying to talk himself into manning up to the ride..Good.XYFNKWBecause I’d hate for your friends at home to find out how you chickened out of a little haunted house in a theme park, Jordan said, implying.that he would never let this go if he didn’t go in..Dillon swallowed hard.XYFNKWHe knew what he had to do.XYFNKWFine, he said.XYFNKWI’ll go.first.XYFNKWHe walked up to the entrance and into the house..Before he entered, the operator of the house grabbed his arm.XYFNKWThis house isn’t for the feint of heart, he said with a deadly serious tone.XYFNKWBeware the demons, he stated as he let go of him..The door had the word MURDER written over it in what appeared to be blood, and there were ghostly sounds coming from different directions as Dillon.approached.XYFNKWOf course Dillon knew that this was all part of the show.XYFNKWHe had been in one of these houses before when he and his family visited the amusement park that wasn’t far from the town they lived in.XYFNKWStill, due to recent circumstances, he couldn’t help but be a little on edge..He entered and the place was dark at first then there was a flash of light and.something whipped across his path.XYFNKWHe couldn’t make it out but figured that it was probably someone pretending to be a ghost.XYFNKWThen the lights came on and flickered in intermittent patterns simulating an electrical short.XYFNKWThe hair on the back of Dillon’s neck stood up.XYFNKWThe mood was creepy.XYFNKWThe walls were stained with what appeared to be blood and there were fingernail marks down the one side, portraying as though someone was sucked into the house against their will..There was a musty old smell in the air, and he could hear really faint sounds of high-pitched shrieks and low growls..As Dillon walked down the corridor he felt something buzz his head from behind and continue on down the hall.XYFNKWHe twitched and jumped to the side, eyes.searching the gloom.XYFNKWMust’ve been a simulated bat, he reasoned with himself..With a swallow, he pushed on..The sounds were getting louder: women screams, low guttural growls of.some unseen creature, and howling of souls being tormented..He got to the end of the hall and turned the corner.XYFNKWAs he did, a hand came.out of the wall and touched his shoulder.XYFNKWHe jumped and launched himself against the opposite wall.XYFNKWTwo more hands came out and grabbed him.XYFNKWHe pulled.away his heart pounding furiously.XYFNKWIt’s just a ride, he told himself as he tried to keep his distance from the edges of the hallway as he jogged away from where.the hands were.XYFNKWHe hit something sticky: spider webs!XYFNKWAs he pulled them from.his face he noticed that the hall opened up to the top and the path wound down..At the top of the opened hall was a huge spider.XYFNKWHe let out a shriek and jumped.back, suddenly having the image in his head about the spiders he and Gwen were running from in his dreams.XYFNKWIn its legs appeared to be the body of a person that was being wound up in its web.XYFNKWHe rubbed his eyes then looked closer at it.XYFNKWNo..He could tell that it was definitely a fake by the way the thing moved.XYFNKWHis breath came easier and his heart slowed as he calmed himself down.XYFNKWGet it together Dillon.XYFNKWThis is just a ride , he said aloud to himself..Dillon put his head down and ran under the spider.XYFNKWAs he came out the other.side he thought he saw movement of something off to the side.XYFNKWHe noticed a large vent at the base of the wall to his left and swore he saw movement from within, and a flicker of yellow.XYFNKWHe didn’t stay there long enough to figure it out and instead ran to the end of the hall where there was a closed door.XYFNKWDillon tried to open it but it was locked.XYFNKWAs he shook it he heard large footsteps coming from behind him.XYFNKWHe glanced back to see a massive guy who had to have been at least.seven feet tall and built like a body builder!XYFNKWHis face appeared to be zombie-like: dead and rotting.XYFNKWAnd his clothes were tattered, blood-satined, and barely hanging on.XYFNKWHe lumbered toward Dillon methodically.XYFNKWIn his massive arms he held a wicked looking axe.XYFNKWIt was huge with a serrated edge and had a point on it that was probably a foot long with cruel looking barbs all over it.XYFNKWDillon worked the door harder.XYFNKWThe zombie was almost there.XYFNKWHe tugged and pushed.XYFNKWHe glanced back and saw that the zombie was raising his axe..This is just a ride, he said to himself again.XYFNKWCome on!XYFNKWhe screamed at the.door..The zombie had his axe fully overhead.XYFNKWWas this just a ride?XYFNKWDillon began to question himself.XYFNKWHe pushed hard on the door.XYFNKWIt flung open and Dillon fell into the room beyond just as the zombie’s axe came down.XYFNKWHe heard the thud of it hit.the floor and the door slammed shut on its own.XYFNKWDillon breathed a sigh of relief, then pulled himself up..He noticed that he was in a octagonal-shaped room.XYFNKWEach side of the room had full-length mirrors on them which reached all the way to the roof about ten feet from the floor.XYFNKWAs he looked into the mirrors he noticed something strange: there were images of disembodied people coming up behind him.XYFNKWHe turned around, but no one was actually there.XYFNKWNow looking in the opposite mirror, he.noticed the same thing.XYFNKWThe figures were of attractive women who were seemingly moving their hands over his head and shoulders.XYFNKWIt was weird because.he started to actually feel as though there was something touching him.XYFNKWHe swatted where he felt the sensations but nothing changed.XYFNKWThis went on for a moment as he looked into different mirrors.XYFNKWAs he stared into one the woman looked at him, then her eyes went red, and she bared some massive fangs and hissed at him!XYFNKWHe could hear the sound of the hissing as though it was right on.top of him.XYFNKWDillon jumped back and looked somewhere else, but that woman did.the same thing.XYFNKWHe spun around and almost screamed out.XYFNKWIt was as though they.were taunting him.XYFNKWThis went on for what seemed an eternity.XYFNKWEventually Dillon.closed his eyes.XYFNKWAfter a few seconds the sounds of horror stopped and he could.feel that the entire floor he was on was moving up.XYFNKWHe opened his eyes to see the mirrors fade from view as he ascended.XYFNKWBefore the last of the mirrors disappeared, he caught the glimpse of something yellow.XYFNKWHis heart began to race..It was at this point that the young boy wanted off the ride, but he knew there.was no way back.XYFNKWHe had to complete what he started.XYFNKWThe floor came to stop in.a creepy looking, low lit, ancient library.XYFNKWThere were bookshelves against three of the walls, a desk was over to the right, and there appeared to be a body laying on the desk with a knife sticking out of its back..Great … Dillon found himself say aloud as he noticed the body..He looked around the room and noted that the door was behind him.XYFNKWHe had.no desire to check out the real-looking body!XYFNKWHe just turned right for the door..As he reached for the handle a knife landed in the door, missing his head by inches!XYFNKWHe spun around to see a ghoulish-looking creature crouched on the desk.beside the dead man.XYFNKWHe was flipping another knife in his hand.XYFNKWDillon went for.the handle again.XYFNKWAnother knife slammed into the door.XYFNKWDillon’s heart was pounding.XYFNKWMostly because he was now wondering if this was part of the ride or if this guy was actually trying to kill him!He quickly grabbed the handle and pulled.XYFNKWOf course!XYFNKWhe lamented out loud.XYFNKWWhy would the stupid door open in a haunted house?The ghoul smiled as he flipped another knife in the air.XYFNKWThen the book shelves started to moved back and forth and books started to fly all over the.place.XYFNKWDillon noticed that there was a passage behind one of the shelves.XYFNKWHe ran for the opening.XYFNKWA knife landed near him and the shelf closed over the passageway.XYFNKWIt began to open again and another knife landed near him.XYFNKWHe had to.dodge some of the flying books as well.XYFNKWOne hit him in the arm and he noted that it felt more like styrofoam than an actual book.XYFNKWThis helped him remember that it was just a ride.XYFNKWThe passage opened again and he launched himself through.XYFNKWIt closed behind him leaving him in the dark for a second, then the lights came on a really dull red light that barely lit up the hall..Okay, I’ve had enough of this, he thought to himself.XYFNKWTime for the ride to end..The long hallway looked rather plain.XYFNKWIt appeared to be built of rotting wood.that could fall apart at any moment.XYFNKWThere were three windows on each side of.the hallway which had tattered sheets hanging across them that were swaying in,.what seemed to be, a breeze from the outside.XYFNKWAt the end of the hallway there was a large hole in the wall with a big sign over it that read Escape!XYFNKWThe sign was huge, appeared to be written in blood, and was glowing brightly in the dimly lit passage.XYFNKWBut the eeriest thing was that the faint sounds of high-pitched shrieks and low growls had disappeared, leaving him looking down the long hall with just the sound of the breeze coming through the windows..As Dillon took his first step he heard the floor boards creek loudly under his.weight.XYFNKWAs he walked slowly down the hallway he began to hear ghoulish screams and groans coming from the hole.XYFNKWOh that’s better!XYFNKWhe said to himself.sarcastically.XYFNKWThen he saw movement to the left at that top of the wall.XYFNKWThere was another vent.XYFNKWAs he stared at the vent for a moment he suddenly saw two yellow.dots appear, almost like eyes staring at him..He turned from the vent and started to pick up the pace as he went, not wanting to draw this out anymore.XYFNKWWhen he walked by one of the windows he.moved the sheet aside slightly and noticed that the windows were barred.XYFNKWHe also noted the many people strolling up and down the boardwalk beside the haunted house.XYFNKWThey appeared to be having fun going from ride to ride, game to.game.XYFNKWHow he wanted to be outside again!XYFNKWHe refocussed on the exit and increased his pace even more.XYFNKWSuddenly a trap door opened from above and a body that was strung up with a rope around his neck came crashing down in.front of him.XYFNKWIt was pale, covered in blood, and seemed very realistic.XYFNKWDillon jumped back and another one dropped from behind him.XYFNKWThey began to extend their arms..Dillon dodged around the one in front and another two dropped.XYFNKWHe threw himself against the wall and squirmed by them.XYFNKWHe was only a few yards away.from the escape hole now.XYFNKWHe rushed toward it and another two dropped before.he got there but he burst through, trying not to touch them as much as he could..He knew in his head that they weren’t real but he couldn’t resist being freaked.out in the moment.XYFNKWHis emotions took charge and not his logic..He made it to the hole and was about to climb inside when he heard a sickly.hissing sound come from behind.XYFNKWHe knew he shouldn’t look but he just couldn’t.resist his curiosity.XYFNKWHe turned his head back to see a giant-looking rat with glowing yellow eyes quickly dodging through the field of corpses and coming right for him.XYFNKWThat was it!XYFNKWDillon had enough and launched himself into the hole headfirst..He felt himself sliding.XYFNKWHe realized then that the escape was actually a slide..He felt himself tumbling and turning as the slide went to the left and then to the right.XYFNKWIt was dimly lit inside from small pinholes that were in the top of it which apparently let the natural light from outside come in to illuminate enough of the interior so that the rider could see a little as he slid down the twisting turning ride..Dillon screamed as he tumbled.XYFNKWHe knew at this point that the slide was not.meant for you to go down on your stomach but, unfortunately, he was now committed as he twisted and turned, scraping a hand here and a knee there..Dillon turned sharply to the right and then burst through the exit which had wide strips of dark soft plastic material hanging down from the roof which worked as.the covering for the door..The light of the outside stung his eyes as he flew through the door.XYFNKWHe found.himself on the side of the haunted house at the end of the slide that was cleverly decorated as a graveyard.XYFNKWNo one walking by could see the slide exit so as not to ruin the surprise for those who go through the house..He pulled himself from the slide and promptly made it through the exit and.around to the front of the house.XYFNKWThe ride operator turned and smiled at the clearly disturbed boy..Well?XYFNKWhe asked with a mischievous smile..Well what?XYFNKWDillon fumed.XYFNKWYou trying to kill someone?XYFNKWhe yelled..I told you that the house is not for the feint of heart, the operator replied.without concern..That’s an understatement!XYFNKWDillon exclaimed..What part scared you the most?XYFNKWasked the operator.XYFNKWThe people we hire are very good at what they do and we have spared no expense for the visual effects like what you saw in the room of mirrors.XYFNKWI believe that’s my favourite part, he said tipping his nose up slightly in a smug expression..Oh ya … very good, replied Dillon sarcastically.XYFNKWActually he did think that.the room of mirrors was very good, especially how they incorporated blasts of wind around you which helped to simulate the creatures in the mirrors touching.you.XYFNKWHe silently berated himself for not keeping more cool and understanding that was what they were doing to simulate their touch.XYFNKWIt seemed his apparently.legendary observational skills took a hike when he was under emotional distress!No really …?XYFNKWasked the operator.XYFNKWWhat was the scariest part?Dillon had now sufficiently calmed down in order to think rationally about the question.XYFNKWHe tilted his head down as he began to think.XYFNKWThe knife throwing ghoul was pretty scary, he thought to himself.XYFNKWBut then there was that first giant with the axe … No … I would have to say ….Dillon turned to face the operator again.XYFNKWThe operator looked at him with amusement.XYFNKWI think the icing on the cake with your house was the rat, Dillon.said with certainty.XYFNKWYep … The rat was the scariest even though I only saw it for a moment..The operator looked perplexed.XYFNKWWhat rat?XYFNKWhe asked..Dillon laughed.XYFNKWYou know … the one at the end?XYFNKWYou’re just trying to scare.me more, he chuckled..The operator remained stone-faced.XYFNKWWe don’t have a rat in the house..The blood drained from Dillon’s face.XYFNKWThe image of the rat came clearly to.him again and he noticed the same kind of eyes he saw in the coyotes!XYFNKWHe knew.then that someone had tried to kill him again.XYFNKWHis thoughts spun.XYFNKWBut how could it survive in the Oasis without bursting into flames?XYFNKWAnd why are they still after me as the guy on the phone said everything would be okay if I just stopped snooping around?XYFNKWUnless … someone saw me talking to Derek and they know that Derek is somehow involved!Then it struck him.XYFNKWWhere’s my brother?XYFNKWhe blurted..The operator turned and motioned to the house with his hand..No!XYFNKWDillon yelled as he ran to the front door..He was about to go in again when he heard a loud call from the side..Where you going twerp?XYFNKWcame Jordan’s cry..Dillon looked over to see Jordan walking toward them from the slide area..His heart leaped when he saw his brother unharmed.XYFNKWHe ran over and was about.to give him a hug but Jordan quickly shot his hand out and smacked him in the.chest.XYFNKWWhoa!XYFNKWJordan said.XYFNKWIt wasn’t that scary.XYFNKWAt least not for me.XYFNKWKeep your distance little bro..Dillon quickly collected himself.XYFNKWSorry.XYFNKWI … um … thought you were going.to need some comforting and a new pair of pants after that ride, Dillon said, trying to be cool..Sure … Jordan replied with a smirk.XYFNKWLet’s go find some other stuff to do..Thanks for the fright, creepy haunted house dude, he waved to the operator..The operator waved back as he watched the two brothers slip into the crowd once more....16.M O R E Q U E S T I O N S , F E W A N S W E R S.Dillon’s heart wasn’t into any more rides after the haunted house..Jordan tried to coax him into it but to no avail.XYFNKWFinally he just.dismissed his little brother and went on whatever rides he wanted..Dillon waited dutifully at each one, constantly watching his back and jumping around at every little sudden sound that was around him.XYFNKWWhen Jordan got off the ride Dillon would try and act as cool as he could, dismissing his disinterest with not feeling very well..Eventually Jordan played himself out and headed for the rendezvous point where they were supposed to meet Mom, Dad, and the girls.XYFNKWAs it would happen.it was just about that time anyway..As Dillon walked through the park he kept looking over his shoulder his imagination kept running off, picturing a multitude of ways he was about to die..None happened..Mom, Dad, and the girls seemed excited about everything they saw at the park.XYFNKWGwen wouldn’t stop talking!XYFNKWIt was alright with Dillon though, as it kept any attention away from himself so he wouldn’t have to fake being as excited as.everyone else.XYFNKWAt this point he just wanted to get back to the resort and call it a night.XYFNKWThe thing that really troubled him was the fact that the rat creature was able to somehow survive on the resort property without exploding into a ball of.flames like the coyote did.XYFNKWThe only way he could reason this out was that maybe it had something to do with actually touching land?XYFNKWAnd if it did have to..do with touching land, who brought it there?XYFNKWAnd how closely was he being watched that they anticipated him being in the haunted house or were able to get in and release the rat?XYFNKWIt seemed as sound an explanation as any, but without really knowing the details of what those creatures were, and who it was that was behind this, he was really just speculating..As soon as the Hunts made it back to the resort Dillon hurried to the elevator.without saying a word..You okay Dillon, Dad hollered after him..Ya.XYFNKWI just really have to go to the washroom, he yelled back without even.turning his head..Okay, but don’t forget to meet us down here for dinner in an hour, his Mom called after him..Sure thing, he said with a wave as he disappeared around the corner..Dad looked to Jordan..Well, if you gotta go, you gotta go, Jordan said with a laugh..HE WAS THINKING ABOUT MAKING SOME EXCUSE AS TO WHY HE COULDN’T GO,.but then he thought that it actually might be better for him to be out in a public place where there were people around.XYFNKWAfter the coyote incident he was determined to do just that, but the rat caused him to vacillate back and forth from wanting to be shut in, to thinking it was wiser to be around people.XYFNKWEvery encounter he had to this point happened when there was no one around to witness it which made him believe that the people behind this were trying to be.as evasive as possible.XYFNKWSo, in this moment, he decided that he should be around.as many people as he could be..After the Hunts got settled in for dinner Dad opened the conversation.XYFNKWSo,.what did you guys like best about today?XYFNKWhe asked..Gwen went off again telling the family about everything she saw and did..The others let her go for a bit then Claire cut her short.XYFNKWThat’s enough Gwen,.she stated in an exasperated tone.XYFNKWYou’ve already told us everything twice!Gwen stopped talking but put on her pouty look.XYFNKWFine!XYFNKWshe stated as she crossed her arms..What about you boys?XYFNKWasked Mom.XYFNKWWhat was the most exciting thing you.did at the park?Jordan smirked at Dillon.XYFNKWI would have to say that it was the haunted house..Wow!XYFNKWA haunted house?XYFNKWDad asked enthusiastically..Ya.XYFNKWIt was pretty awesome, though I think Dillon would have preferred the.kids carousel, he said with a laugh..Dillon scowled at him.XYFNKWIf only he knew, he thought to himself..You see, we had to go in one at a time and Dillboy here went first.XYFNKWIt must.have scared him so bad that when I was done he came running over to give me a.hug and make sure I was okay!XYFNKWJordan couldn’t help but laugh when he recounted the incident..I was not scared!XYFNKWDillon blurted.XYFNKWI just didn’t think that someone as big and dumb as you would be able to make it without crapping yourself!Jordan slapped Dillon on the head..Boys!XYFNKWMom yelled..They both glared at each other before going back to their appetizers and drinks..After dinner the Hunts decided to hang out at the pool for a couple hours before turning in.XYFNKWThey all went to their rooms and got changed in their swim gear and grabbed their towels..See ya down at the pool Dillboy!XYFNKWJordan said—seemingly happy with the.new nickname he had come up with for his brother—as he headed out the door.of their room..Dillon finished getting changed, grabbed his towel, and headed to the pool..As he was walking through the lobby by the front desk he heard someone call him over.XYFNKWHe jumped a little at the sound of his name but soon collected himself as he noticed that it was Janeen..Dillon promptly jogged over to the desk.XYFNKWWhat is it Janeen?XYFNKWDid you find out what that symbol means?XYFNKWhe asked in a hushed tone, not sure who might be.listening in..Janeen looked at him curiously.XYFNKWWhy are you whispering?XYFNKWshe asked..Oh … uh … it’s just a habit I get into sometimes when I talk about stuff that’s … ah … interesting and mysterious, he lied..Oh, okay, she responded in a hushed tone.XYFNKWWell, I found out that no one.really knows what this symbol means, she said.XYFNKWIt was really weird actually when I was asking around because you would think that someone knows what it.means, or even where it came from.XYFNKWMost people didn’t even notice it on the wall.XYFNKWI finally had to ask a friend of mine who I met when I first started here..He’s an older guy who has been around for a while and I thought for sure he would know something, but he didn’t..Oh … Dillon replied dejectedly.XYFNKWThat’s kind of a bummer..Ya, tell me about it.XYFNKWHe seemed really curious too about why I was asking..Dillon’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that.XYFNKWAnd what did you say?he prodded..I told him that you were asking about it, she said matter-of-factly..Dillon froze, his thoughts spinning..I figured he would be interested in one of his guests being so observant as.we have never had that question before, Janeen confessed innocently..His guests?XYFNKWDillon asked..Oh yeah, Janeen responded with a wave.XYFNKWHe’s one of the board members.who has oversight of the resort.XYFNKWHe’s a nice old man who loves to make sure that his guests have a great time!Thanks!XYFNKWDillon thought to himself as he started to wonder if the reason he seemed to have a target on himself was somehow due to the fact that others now.knew he was asking questions..Oh … okay thanks Janeen, Dillon said, trying to be as upbeat as possible..No problem!XYFNKWshe responded with a big smile..Dillon walked away in a daze, not sure what to think.XYFNKWDid this conspiracy go.right to the top?XYFNKWHow else would someone know that he was snooping around?XYFNKWIt.just didn’t add up though that someone would risk exposure if something bad happened to a twelve year old kid at their resort.XYFNKWDillon knew that he may have.gotten in over his head, but in reality, it wasn’t his fault.XYFNKWIt was Derek’s and those people he works for.XYFNKWDillon and his family wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for them orchestrating the circumstances behind them coming to the resort.XYFNKWDillon decided that Derek would have to answer a lot of questions when he made contact with him next time..After about an hour of hanging out by the pool Dillon started to relax more..He even went and played an epic game of pool dodge ball with Gwen and some.other kids within his age range that he met poolside.XYFNKWHe figured that no one would be stupid enough to try and attack him right in the middle of the resort with all the people around.XYFNKWThat thought made him feel safe..The rest of his family seemed to be enjoying themselves too.XYFNKWAs Dillon played, the recent memories of his ordeals would surface for a moment, but then.he would repress them and carry on with the fun he was having.XYFNKWDespite all of.his thrill and desire for excitement and adventure, he was beginning to just enjoy being a kid on vacation with his family..He quickly jumped out of the pool for a moment, wiped himself with his towel, and grabbed his virgin margarita.XYFNKWHe sucked back on the straw like his life depended on it..Come on Dillon!XYFNKWhe heard Devon, a kid who was about his own age, call.from the pool..Dillon put his hand up indicating that he would just be a moment.XYFNKWHe slammed the margarita cup down and was about to head back into the water when he heard someone behind him say, Mr.XYFNKWDillon Hunt.XYFNKWYou have a message.at the front desk for you..Dillon turned to see one of the bellman standing there..Who could that be from?XYFNKWDillon’s Mom asked as she looked up from her.book..Who knows?XYFNKWDillon responded, trying to play it cool.XYFNKWHe actually didn’t know who it was from, and even feared he was going to get another call from the.deepen-voiced man.XYFNKWOh … it’s probably from Sarah, he said, trying to make up something on the fly.XYFNKWShe’s probably just wondering how I’m doing and didn’t want to use up any minutes on my cell..Well that’s courteous of her, Mom said as she returned to her book.XYFNKWI’ve always liked that girl..Dillon rolled his eyes and headed for the lobby.XYFNKWIt’s a good thing Dad wasn’t around to hear that, Dillon thought to himself.XYFNKWHe would have been a little more suspicious..As he approached the front desk and mentioned who he was, the guy there handed him a note and said, The man who left this was insistent that I give it to you in person at the desk..Oh … okay, replied Dillon as he took the note, feeling a little.overwhelmed with the apparent seriousness of the message..He opened up the folded paper and all that was written on it was a phone number..He looked back to the guest services agent who was already busying himself.at the computer.XYFNKWWhat did the guy look like?XYFNKWhe asked..The man thought for a moment.XYFNKWThe only thing I really recall was that he was, caucasian, muscular, and bald with an odd tattoo on his head..He immediately felt a sigh of relief inside of himself as he realized that it was Derek.XYFNKWHe rushed over to the business center, sat himself down in one of the cubicles, and was about to pick up the phone when a thought struck him.XYFNKWHe immediately put the phone down.XYFNKWIf the conspirators were the ones who were running the resort then of course they would probably have the phones tapped..He realized that he would need to use his cell which was in his room..Dillon ran over to where his stuff was poolside and grabbed his card-key..What’s up?XYFNKWasked Mom as she looked up from her book again..Oh nothing, replied Dillon.XYFNKWI just remembered that I forgot something in.my room.XYFNKWHe darted away from her as quickly as possible, not giving her a chance to ask anymore questions..He ran across the lobby as quickly as he could and into the closest available.elevator.XYFNKWEven though his room was only a few floors up it felt as if the elevator ride would last for an eternity!XYFNKWFinally the doors opened and he darted down the hall toward his room.XYFNKWAs he got his card out he noticed that something wasn’t right: his door was already unlocked and cracked open with the upper secondary.door lock from the inside opened and resting on the frame!Dillon froze.XYFNKWHis heart pounded.XYFNKWHis thoughts whirled, trying to remember if.he was the one who left his door opened by accident when he exited.XYFNKWNo.XYFNKWHe remembered closing it tightly before heading to the pool and he didn’t think Jordan had come up yet.XYFNKWSomeone else must have opened it after and, either didn’t close it when they left, or were still in there!Despite his better judgement, Dillon took a couple deep breaths then, with one hand, opened the door slowly.XYFNKWHe took a step inside and listened for a moment.XYFNKWHe heard nothing except for the low buzz of the air conditioning unit..He felt the chill of the cool air on his damp shorts.XYFNKWHello!XYFNKWhe called out.XYFNKWIs someone there?XYFNKWNo response..Hello!XYFNKWhe called out again.XYFNKWI’m packing heat!XYFNKWhe warned.XYFNKWI don’t want.any trouble..He wasn’t sure if that was water from the pool or sweat which was dripping.down his forehead.XYFNKWHe took another step inside and peeked around the first corner that led to the bathroom.XYFNKWIt was dark.XYFNKWHe paused and listened but heard nothing.XYFNKWHe approached the bathroom, reached for the light, flicked it on quickly, and jumped inside..He shrieked and fell backward as he saw someone staring at him!XYFNKWHis heart.pounded faster as he fell back into the tub taking the shower curtain with him..He grunted and shrieked, trying to get the curtain off of him, thinking that he was about to be leaped upon and throttled at any moment.XYFNKWHe was finally able to.rip the curtain off and pulled himself from the tub.XYFNKWIt was only then that he realized that the person he saw was himself in the mirror!XYFNKWHe chuckled.XYFNKWThen he.became serious once more, realizing that he could still be in danger..By this time he knew that, if there was someone in the room, then they either.fled when he was wrestling with himself in the tub, or they were around the corner, ready to confront him.XYFNKWAt this point he was starting not to care.XYFNKWHe marched around the corner and turned on the light.XYFNKWNo one was there.XYFNKWHe looked.around to see if anything was out of place, but everything seemed normal at first glance..He went to his side table and grabbed his phone.XYFNKWAs he did, he noticed that.his back pack wasn’t where it should have been.XYFNKWIt was on the end of the bed instead of in the corner with his suitcase where he left it, and the top zipper was cracked open.XYFNKWHe knew at this point that someone was looking through his stuff..Then it hit him!XYFNKWHe leaped over the bed and reached underneath it to where the.slight rip in the boxspring was.XYFNKWHe felt around for a moment and then breathed a sigh of relief when he felt that the watch and arrow head were right where he had hid them..He unlocked his phone and dialled the number on the paper..What took you so long Dillon?XYFNKWDerek asked when he answered..Sorry, I wanted to make sure no one else was listening in so I went to my.room to use my cell..Good work Dillon, Derek replied.XYFNKWThat shows a level of maturity beyond.your years..Thanks.XYFNKWBut listen Derek.XYFNKWSomeone knows I’m involved.XYFNKWI didn’t have time.to tell you when we spoke the other day but they tried to kill me at the information center after you talked to Tom Tom.XYFNKWI was there, and when you left,.I was attacked by some … creatures, Dillon explained.XYFNKWTom Tom is gone!XYFNKWHis.voice cracked as he choked up..There was a short pause on Derek’s end.XYFNKWI know, Derek admitted.XYFNKWI saw.those creatures take off after you when I was just leaving the center.XYFNKWAll I could do was let a few shots go in order to buy you some time and hoped that you would make it to the Oasis before they caught you.XYFNKWAnd you did..Did you know that the creatures can’t come onto the Oasis property without.burning up?XYFNKWDillon asked..We weren’t sure.XYFNKWActually, we weren’t even really sure that the creatures existed until I saw them chasing you that day.XYFNKWIt was only a theory up to then..Do you guys have any idea what they are or where they came from?XYFNKWDillon.asked in desperation, trying to get some answers..We don’t know.XYFNKWSomething bad is going on here and those who try to uncover it tend to go missing, replied Derek.XYFNKWThat’s why we need to take these people down as soon as we can.XYFNKWUnfortunately, they are really cunning in preventing us from going after them.XYFNKWWe suspect they are getting some outside.help, but don’t know who that is.XYFNKWAre you still up for helping us?XYFNKWDerek asked..Now Dillon was the one who paused.XYFNKWHe knew that he was already in over.his head and that his family were supposed to be here for another week and a half, which is a long time to be constantly looking over your shoulder for the next attack..I’m in, he heard himself say.XYFNKWHe almost couldn’t believe that he was signing up for something that could potentially kill him.XYFNKWBut what choice did he have?XYFNKWNone.XYFNKWAnd he knew it..But I have to be honest with you Derek, he continued, I’m getting scared.as someone tried to take me out in the haunted house at the amusement park with.another creature, and I know my room was searched.XYFNKWI suspect they were looking.for the watch and arrow head..Did they find it?XYFNKWDerek blurted..No.XYFNKWThankfully I hid them after I got back from the amusement park, he said.XYFNKWHe could hear Derek relax a little on the other end..Okay good, Derek replied.XYFNKWSee, you are getting good at this..Getting good at this?XYFNKWDillon asked exasperatedly.XYFNKWI don’t even know what.this is!It’s okay Dillon, Derek reassured.XYFNKWI’ll be there with you through the rest.of this.XYFNKWThe next thing we need to do is that you have to get to town tomorrow.morning by 10:00.XYFNKWMeet me at 1587 Palm Tree Crescent, which was John’s place.while he was here.XYFNKWAnd don’t forget to bring the watch and arrowhead..How am I supposed to do that?You’re a smart kid, Derek replied.XYFNKWI know you’ll figure it out.XYFNKWAnd don’t.worry about anyone getting into your room tonight.XYFNKWMy friends and I will make.sure that you have a good night sleep.XYFNKWRemember: John is counting on you.XYFNKWThat.is, if he’s still alive..Wait what?XYFNKWDillon said, but there was no reply.XYFNKWDerek had hung up already..Great!XYFNKWDillon said as he hung up the phone, his thoughts astir.XYFNKWJust get to.town, Dillon.XYFNKWYou’ll figure it out, Dillon.XYFNKWHelp us save John, Dillon!XYFNKWhe said sarcastically.XYFNKWDoes anyone realize that I’m only twelve!..17.J O H N ’ S H O U S E.Dillon headed back to the pool after he got off the phone with Derek..As he went he was racking his brain as to how he was going to.convince Mom and Dad to let him go to town.XYFNKWSure, he had gone to.the information center the other day by himself, but his parents didn’t know that as they thought he was hanging out at the pool with Jordan.XYFNKWOn that occasion he.also knew that they were going to be gone longer than he was, so it was easy for him to just go.XYFNKWThis was different.XYFNKWAs far as he knew, his parents were planning on staying around the resort and just chilling.XYFNKWHe figured the chances of him slipping away without them noticing was pretty well nil..He also didn’t want his parents tagging along as he needed to make sure that.he was able to get away and head to 1587 Palm Tree Crescent to meet up with.Derek.XYFNKWHe knew he should be leery about going along with a stranger.XYFNKWHis parents always spoke to the kids about the danger they could get into if they were too trusting of strangers, but he just had a feeling he could trust Derek..Besides, with all the weird stuff that had happened to him up to this point, and his life being in jeopardy, he had no reason to believe that Derek wasn’t telling the truth about Orion.XYFNKWIn reality, he had no choice but to trust Derek..As he approached he decided that the direct approach would probably be the.best..Hey Mom, Dad, Dillon said as he walked up.XYFNKWI don’t suppose I would be.able to take the bus to town tomorrow?XYFNKWThere’s a couple of things I would like to.check out..I don’t know man, replied Dad.XYFNKWI was looking forward to just hanging out.here tomorrow..You don’t have to come, Dillon was quick to respond.XYFNKWI can take it by myself.XYFNKWI have a phone just in case I need to get a hold of you guys..Sorry, but I’m not comfortable with you going by yourself, said Dad..Don’t look at me little bro, Jordan added as he closed his eyes while reclining back in his deck chair..What about Claire?XYFNKWasked Dillon desperately..Claire, who was sitting next to Jordan scoffed..Dillon could feel his chances of getting to town slip through his grasp.XYFNKWAre.you sure you don’t want to come Claire?XYFNKWDillon asked, a plan starting to hatch.in his mind..I’m not really up for it Dillon, she said..But I’m sure I saw a Jeff’s brand-name shirt store, he said, stressing the.Jeff part of the name.XYFNKWOr maybe it was Jeff’s new and used emporium.XYFNKWI can’t quite remember.XYFNKWNo.XYFNKWI know, it was Jeff’s Tall Dark Clothing Outlet..Claire almost fell over!XYFNKWDillon knew that Claire had now realized that he knew about her boyfriend at home, Jeff Stalman.XYFNKWMom and Dad specifically told.all the kids that they were not to date until they were at least sixteen, but when Claire met Jeff Dillon figured she threw that mandate out faster than a ninety five mile an hour fast ball!XYFNKWAnd now he was using that fact against her!XYFNKWDillon.would pull that card if he needed to..Okay, okay, she blurted.XYFNKWI would love to take you, she said with gritted.teeth..Great!XYFNKWDillon beamed.XYFNKWWe need to leave at nine.XYFNKWIs that okay with you guys, he said as he turned back to Mom and Dad..They both looked at each other for a moment then nodded their approval..Claire glared at him..Dillon stretched and yawned.XYFNKWMan it’s getting late.XYFNKWI’m going to turn in for.the night.XYFNKWSee you in the morning Claire, he said as he collected the rest of his things and headed for the Lobby.XYFNKWYou might want to consider going to bed too...We have an early day tomorrow, he smiled at her..If her eyes were daggers then Dillon would have died a thousand times over..DILLON LOOKED AROUND THE LOBBY TRYING TO APPEAR CASUAL AS HE WAITED.for Claire to show up.XYFNKWIt was only five minutes past nine which was not unusual.for his sister, especially due to the fact that she was probably still angry at him for coercing her into helping him get to town.XYFNKWKnowing her, she would probably.stretch it out to the last minute.XYFNKWDillon wasn’t too worried yet as the first shuttle bus didn’t leave for town until about twenty passed nine.XYFNKWHe still had time..As Dillon waited, his thoughts kept going to the meaning of the symbol on.the wall.XYFNKWPerhaps maybe the only person who might be able to help him with this.knowledge was Tom Tom, and Dillon didn’t even know if he was still alive.XYFNKWHe.thought about asking another tribe member—maybe the woman from the bike shop—but he really didn’t know who he could trust and didn’t want to risk it..A moment later Claire surprised him by shambling out of the elevator and into the lobby.XYFNKWShe had a whole eight minutes to spare!XYFNKWThis was.uncharacteristically like her.XYFNKWAs she approached Dillon he could tell that she was still mad at the way he was able to get her to volunteer to go with him into town..Good morning Claire, Dillon said in an innocent tone, trying to appear as.meek as possible..Morning, she grunted.XYFNKWThe look on her face further confirmed that she wasn’t just mad, but potentially infuriated with her little brother..Dillon didn’t know what to say as they both walked outside to the front of the resort in order to wait for the shuttle.XYFNKWThe silence was deafening!They got to the bus stop and stood there, neither saying a word.XYFNKWDillon looked around, pretending to be interested in some birds that perched on a pole.nearby.XYFNKWClaire looked down at her phone, tapping away at one of her games..Dillon cleared his throat a couple of times seeing if she would look up from her game.XYFNKWNo response.XYFNKWThe tension was so thick that you could cut it with a knife!After a moment Claire finally turned to Dillon and spouted angrily, How do you know about Jeff?Dillon wasn’t really surprised by the question as Claire had gone to great lengths to keep her taboo relationship a secret.XYFNKWI overheard you talking to one of your friends about it when I was passing by your room, he responded.XYFNKWI also.saw you and Jeff hanging out in the park after school a few times on my walk.home..Ya but that doesn’t mean anything, Claire snapped.XYFNKWLot’s of girls and guys.hang out!Yes but normally the guys don’t give the girls a flower like I witnessed just.before spring break of last year, Dillon said with a wry smile.XYFNKWNot to mention the notes you have neatly tucked into your binder, or the kiss you gave him after school.XYFNKWDo you want me to continue?Claire fumed!XYFNKWHow do you know about the notes?XYFNKWshe demanded..One of them fell out of your binder once and I found it.XYFNKWHe paused.XYFNKWAnd it.was a good thing that I found it and not Mom and Dad, he asserted.XYFNKWAnyway, I.didn’t know what it was until I opened it and found that Jeff was swearing his undying love to you..Claire’s face went beet red at that last remark..So after discovering what it was I thought that the decent thing to do would.be to put it back when you weren’t looking and pretend that nothing ever happened..She relaxed a little at Dillon’s display of discretion..Come on Claire, Dillon continued.XYFNKWI didn’t want you to get in trouble..That’s why I didn’t say anything before..But what about now?XYFNKWClaire asked, her anger starting to rise again with the.thought of Dillon’s play on her that got her stuck going with him to town..Sorry about that, Dillon replied.XYFNKWBut I really need to get to town and I knew that Mom and Dad wouldn’t let me go without someone else coming—.someone older—and you seemed like the best choice..Why do you need to go there so badly?XYFNKWasked his sister, her curiosity starting to peak...Oh … it’s nothing important, Dillon replied, trying hard to think of a good.reason that would allow them to split up.XYFNKWIt’s just some boring stuff that I read in one of my books that I want to check out.XYFNKWHe pulled his backpack up onto his shoulder a little more as he saw the shuttle bus approaching the stop.XYFNKWHow about you head to the mall and I’ll meet you there after?Oh no.XYFNKWYou conned me into going with you to keep an eye on you and that’s.just what I’m going to do!XYFNKWMom and Dad expect us to stay together, remember?Claire replied angrily..Dillon took a step back.XYFNKWYou won’t have fun where I’m going, he shot back..Does it matter?XYFNKWI didn’t even want to come in the first place!Dillon was dumbfounded.XYFNKWHe didn’t see this coming.XYFNKWAnd he knew he.couldn’t take Claire with him.XYFNKWHe needed to think of something fast..Wouldn’t you have more fun at the mall?Maybe.XYFNKWBut it wouldn’t be as much fun as making your life miserable for a.couple of hours, she replied with a wicked grin..Fine.XYFNKWHow about I give you my weeks worth of allowance?Claire stared at him.XYFNKWAnd … you … can use ten of my minutes to call Jeff.when we get back, he said desperately..Claire was silent.XYFNKWOkay.XYFNKWThat sounds reasonable, she smiled as the bus pulled up..Dillon shook his head in disbelief as he walked onto the bus behind his sister..He was thankful that it wasn’t Jordan he had to bribe as he was sure his brother would have been a little more suspicious about why he wanted to be alone..Fortunately, Claire wasn’t as deep of a thinker as he was..DILLON, USING THE MAPS APP ON HIS PHONE, HAD NO PROBLEM FINDING 1587.Palm Tree Crescent.XYFNKWIt was about a fifteen minute walk from where the bus had.dropped him and Claire off, and he planned it just about right with the pick up.and drop off schedule for the bus when he looked at it the night before.XYFNKWIn reality,.the residential area of the Oasis Resort wasn’t really that big.XYFNKWIt was mainly reserved for members of the tribe with a few really nice condos and houses for.people like Janeen and that Aussie bellman from the hotel who came there to work..The most striking thing about the residential area was how clean it was!XYFNKWAll.the lawns were cut neatly, the hedges trimmed, and the flowers that grew there.looked well taken care of.XYFNKWIt didn’t look as though there was even any wear-and-.tear on the streets, sidewalks, fences, or signs!XYFNKWDillon thought that it seemed kind of creepy.XYFNKWThe only thing that made it halfway normal was the fact that there were kids out playing, moms strolling along the sidewalks with their baby strollers and little ones in tow, and a few others out walking their dogs.XYFNKWThat kind of activity put Dillon at ease as it reminded him of the street that he lived on back home..In one hundred feet take the next right onto Palm Tree Crescent, said the.melodic woman’s voice of the GPS, which brought Dillon’s thoughts back to why he had come all this way.XYFNKWHe immediately stopped gazing around and focused his attention to where he was going..When he made it to Palm Tree Crescent the GPS sounded again.XYFNKWTurn right.onto Palm Tree Crescent, she said.XYFNKWYour destination is fifty feet on your left..Dillon double tapped his phone and swiped up to get rid of the mapping..As he approached the house he noticed a man sitting in a car across from the.address.XYFNKWHe immediately recognized it as Derek.XYFNKWDerek, as soon as he saw the boy, got out of the car and came over to him.XYFNKWHe smiled and nodded as he did..Good to see you could make it.XYFNKWI knew you wouldn’t disappoint..Look, I can help, but I’ve got to leave here by 10:45 at the latest.XYFNKWThe next.bus comes at 11:15 and I promised my parents we’d be back on that bus..Derek laughed and put his hands up, motioning for Dillon to slow down..Don’t worry kid, we’ll be out of here in no time..Dillon breathed easier and nodded.XYFNKWSo, this is the place, he said, trying to.contain his nervousness which he knew he was doing a terrible job at..Yep.XYFNKWThe last residence of John Taylor Sebastian, Derek replied soberly..He then looked to Dillon again.XYFNKWYou did bring the watch and arrow head, didn’t.you?Of course I did, Dillon said, reaching into his pocket.XYFNKWHe was about to pull.them out, but Derek stopped him..Not here, he whispered.XYFNKWLet’s wait till we’re inside..Dillon nodded and zipped the bag back up..They both approached the front door.XYFNKWDoes someone else live here now?asked Dillon..Actually someone does.XYFNKWBut the friends I work with have made sure that they won’t be back for at least two hours..The way Derek talked about his friends sent a chill down Dillon’s back.XYFNKWHe wasn’t sure why as Derek didn’t say it in a cryptic manner or by using a Batman.voice, but the mention of others from a secret organization that he didn’t really know anything about was kind of creepy.XYFNKWDillon shook the thoughts away as he.knew that the questions he had for Derek about the people he worked for would.have to wait for another time..Derek turned the door handle, but the door appeared to be locked.XYFNKWHe then reached in his pocket and produced a small square black device.XYFNKWHe pushed a button on the device and a small flat rod snapped out of the end of it.XYFNKWDerek forced the rod into the door lock, jiggled it around a little, and then pushed another button.XYFNKWDillon heard the distinctive sound of the locking mechanism moving and then the click as it finished its revolution.XYFNKWDerek looked down at.Dillon and smiled.XYFNKWStandard issue, he said with a light chuckle as he opened the door..Now Dillon really did want to meet the people that Derek worked for if only.to get his hands on one of those awesome devices!Derek entered the hallway and motioned for Dillon to do the same.XYFNKWWhen they were both in the house Derek shut and locked the door again.XYFNKWHe turned to.Dillon.XYFNKWOkay, now you can pull out the watch and the arrow head..Dillon took the two items out.XYFNKWI’m not sure what you want me to do with these, he said..I don’t know either, replied Derek.XYFNKWBut those items were mailed directly.to us by John just before he went missing so I have to assume they are incredibly.important in finding out what happened to him.XYFNKWI’m trusting you to be able to figure out what they’re for..Dillon swallowed hard as he began to feel the gravity of the situation come.down on him.XYFNKWOkay, he said at length, but you need to give me a moment to.think about this..Sure.XYFNKWNo problem.XYFNKWBut let’s think about it somewhere else in this house..Okay.XYFNKWWhere?XYFNKWasked Dillon..I’m thinking we start in the room he used as a study while he was here,.Derek replied..Okay.XYFNKWWhere is that?Follow me, said Derek as he started to move through the house..The two trespassers went down the hallway, through another room, and to a.set of stairs.XYFNKWDerek took them up the stairs and to the room that was directly across at the top.XYFNKWDillon was amazed at how large this house seemed.XYFNKWIt didn’t look nearly this big from the outside..The room they entered appeared to be a kid’s room now.XYFNKWIt had a single bed,.a small dresser that was decorated like Lightning McQueen, and tons of toys scattered throughout..This was his study?XYFNKWDillon asked, not even trying slightly to hide his sarcastic tone..Derek nodded as he began to move around the room as though he was trying.to remember the layout from when John was the renter..Were you in this room before?XYFNKWasked Dillon as he noted Derek’s.movements..Not exactly, he replied, still moving around as though he was picturing a.desk here, and some chairs there.XYFNKWI Skyped with him a number of times while.he was performing his work here, he said, glancing back at Dillon who was now looking more intensely at the watch..Dillon opened up the watch and looked to where the hands should have been..It was weird that the hands were missing.XYFNKWHe just assumed that it was incredibly old and they got damaged somehow and were beyond repair..Did this thing work when you had it?XYFNKWDillon asked.XYFNKWI mean, do you know.what happened to the hands?No, replied Derek with a curious tone to his voice.XYFNKWI always just assumed.that it got damaged before it got to us..Dillon looked more closely, then grabbed his pocket knife out, flipped it open, and started trying to pry the glass off.XYFNKWSurprisingly it came up without much effort..That was way too easy, Dillon said as he looked to Derek..Well we know it was opened at least once when the hands were taken out,.Derek postulated, coming closer to see Dillon at work with the watch.XYFNKWBut why.would John do that?I don’t know.XYFNKWUnless … Dillon took the arrowhead he had found and started examining it.XYFNKWHere!XYFNKWLook, he said excitedly to Derek as he pointed to.something on one side of it..It looks like a small hole, Derek said, not quite catching on..Dillon nodded as he took the arrowhead and placed it into the watch where.the hands were supposed to go.XYFNKWIt fit perfectly!XYFNKWAs soon as he connected the arrowhead with the watch pin it started to spin.XYFNKWDillon began moving around the.room holding out the watch and seeing what the arrowhead would do.XYFNKWIt spun around a little and then started to aim to the right.XYFNKWHe walked that way, then it started to aim to the left a little.XYFNKWEvery time Dillon moved the way the watch was pointing it would readjust a little until it finally stayed pointing at the wall where the kid’s dresser was..Derek quickly moved the dresser out of the way.XYFNKWThere didn’t seem to be anything out of the ordinary with this part of the wall, but the arrowhead was definitely pointing at it, and Dillon figured there had to be a reason.XYFNKWHe moved closer to the wall and inspected it.XYFNKWEverything seemed to be normal.XYFNKWHe ran his.hand along it and didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary..I don’t know what to make of it, he said, seeming a little confused..Maybe we just need to cut into it to see what’s there..Derek didn’t like that prospect.XYFNKWI don’t think we can do that, he told Dillon.seriously.XYFNKWKeep looking and I’ll search around the rest of the room to see if there is anything else that can help us out..Did anyone else from Orion come here before us and search for any clues that John might have left behind?XYFNKWDillon asked before he started poking around..Yes.XYFNKWThat’s the disturbing part, Derek replied.XYFNKWWe had some of our best people with their high-tech equipment come in here and they found nothing..Some of them suspected that there was a dampening field around the resort as our surveillance equipment couldn’t see anything from either the inside or outside.XYFNKWThe only signal that seems to get in or out are cell signals.XYFNKWThat’s probably because they’re trying to maintain a low profile.XYFNKWNot having cell service might elicit too many complaints.XYFNKWThe happier they keep their guests, the more business they do, which means more profits..What about the more non-subtle tactic of taking walls apart?XYFNKWDillon asked..Derek shook his head.XYFNKWNo.XYFNKWWe prefer to stay as covert as possible.XYFNKWThat would have just drawn too much attention.XYFNKWWe have to resort to stealth until we.can find out who, or what, we’re dealing with here..Derek paused for a moment as if trying to choose his words wisely.XYFNKWOrion.doesn’t like attracting any attention to itself if possible.XYFNKWIt’s kind of a mandate that’s been laid out..Dillon nodded, trying to take it all in, then looked back to the wall.XYFNKWAs he did, he noticed, what looked to be three small dots on the wall.XYFNKWFor some reason he didn’t notice them when he first looked, but now they were here, plain as could be.XYFNKWImmediately his mind whirled back to when he first found the arrowhead.XYFNKWThe pattern of the dots seemed familiar.XYFNKWHe took the arrowhead off.the watch pin and looked at the bumps he had seen before.XYFNKWThey appeared as though they would be a perfect match.XYFNKWHe took the arrowhead and put the pins.into the holes.XYFNKWThere was a click..Derek heard the click a few feet away and rushed over to see what Dillon had found.XYFNKWAs he came over he saw Dillon push on the wall.XYFNKWA section about one.foot by one foot depressed into the wall and hinged to the left.XYFNKWIt was a cleverly designed door as the seams were so well hidden that you couldn’t even tell there was a door there..Remind me to ask John, when we find him, how he was able to make such.an ingenious hiding space, Derek said..The mention of finding John alive gave Dillon hope.XYFNKWIt was nice for him to hear that Derek was optimistic about that prospect.XYFNKWThe thought of this also gave Dillon a longing that Tom Tom might still be alive as well.XYFNKWThis brought a seriousness to him that he rarely experienced.XYFNKWHe knew he had to do what he could to help these men, and for some reason Derek believed that he was the one.to be able to help do just that.XYFNKWDillon, on the other hand, had huge doubts about this..Well … go on, Derek prodded when he saw that Dillon had paused after opening the door..Dillon bent down and looked inside the hole.XYFNKWThe only thing he saw was a medium sized black backpack.XYFNKWHe reached inside, grabbed hold of one of the straps, and was about to pull it out when Derek suddenly cocked his head toward.the door..What?XYFNKWasked Dillon with a tone of urgency in his voice..Derek turned back to Dillon.XYFNKWWe’re not alone, he whispered as a he pulled.out his gun..What!XYFNKWYou mean you didn’t have anyone on the outside as a lookout?Dillon spouted..We’re a little short staffed right now, Derek replied in a loud whisper as he.cocked his gun....18.T H E M E R C E N A R Y.What’s that?XYFNKWDillon asked, as loud as he dared, pointing at.Derek’s gun..Duh … It’s a gun, came Derek’s sarcastic reply..I know it’s a gun!XYFNKWreplied Dillon.XYFNKWBut what’s it for?Derek glanced at him with that, Really kid?XYFNKWexpression..Okay I know what it’s for!XYFNKWDillon whispered a little louder as he rose to stand beside Derek.XYFNKWBut is it really necessary?I don’t know, came Derek’s sharp reply.XYFNKWBut I’d rather have it and not need it then not have it and need it!What if it’s just the owners of the house?That’s doubtful.XYFNKWI know for a fact that the owners are still detained, Derek.whispered matter-of-factly..They could hear some light movement coming up the stairs..Well I really don’t want to see anyone get shot today!XYFNKWEspecially not me!Dillon whispered emphatically..Okay … okay … Derek said as he placed his gun back in its concealed spot under his shirt.XYFNKWHe then bent down and reached under his pant leg and produced a small combat knife..What’s that?XYFNKWDillon asked again..Derek just shook his head at him.XYFNKWListen Dillon, I’m not going into a possible fight without some protection.XYFNKWI’ll try not to kill anyone, okay..Dillon nodded his head up and down so fast that he looked like one of those bobble heads people have on their dashboards..Quick!XYFNKWWe only have a second, Derek said as he darted to the side of the.door..What do you want me to do?Just stay there, Derek replied..What?XYFNKWAnd be used as bait?Derek shrugged his shoulders..And what if he has a gun and shoots at me before you have a chance to take.him down?Then run and try not to get shot!XYFNKWDerek’s reply was less than comforting..I’m only twelve remember!XYFNKWI’m too young to die!Derek put a finger to his mouth, telling Dillon to be quiet..Dillon could feel his heart pound in his chest.XYFNKWHe was sure that it was going.to explode at any moment.XYFNKWIt sounded as though the person who was coming up.the stairs was trying to be as quiet as they could but were failing due to the aged stair boards that creaked ever so slightly with any amount of pressure..Eventually Dillon saw a tall figure emerge from the stairway.XYFNKWHe was wearing a.dark balaclava, had kaki shorts on and a Hawaiian short sleeved shirt.XYFNKWIt looked ridiculous, but Dillon didn’t laugh as he noticed immediately that the man was carrying a gun..Dillon made eye contact with him which was enough to trigger his fight or.flight response.XYFNKWNope, he said as he ran to the side and dived behind the bed..He could hear the man move up the rest of the stairs quickly and head for the.room.XYFNKWAs soon as he entered the room Derek charged into him, sending the attacker flying into the wall.XYFNKWThe man managed to stay on his feet.XYFNKWHe spun to meet Derek, gun leading.XYFNKWDerek managed to sidestep and knock the gun out wide.as a shot went off..Dillon flinched when the shot fired.XYFNKWHe saw the two men entangled, fighting.for their lives..Derek spun his knife around and sliced the attacker on the arm that held the.gun.XYFNKWThe attacker grunted in pain but stubbornly hung on to his weapon.XYFNKWHe tried.to get another shot off, but Derek pushed his arm out wide again.XYFNKWThe bullet sank into the wall beside Dillon’s head..Derek grabbed the gun arm with his empty hand and held it up high as the.attacker struggled to get free.XYFNKWHe sliced down on his arm again.XYFNKWThis time the gun came loose and dropped to the ground as drops of blood poured down onto.the floor.XYFNKWDerek was forced to let go at that point as the man punched him three times in the ribs.XYFNKWHe quickly put some distance between him and the attacker as.each sized the other up..From behind his back the attacker pulled a knife about the same size as Derek’s.XYFNKWDerek smiled.XYFNKWThe man came forward.XYFNKWAs fast as lightning Derek pulled.his gun from behind his back and shot the attacker in the leg.XYFNKWThe man went down in agony.XYFNKWAs he crumpled, Derek gave him a clean roundhouse to the head.which laid him out flat..See!XYFNKWDerek exclaimed as he looked at Dillon who was now coming out from behind the bed.XYFNKWBang … down.XYFNKWThat’s how it works with guns!Dillon bobbed his head up and down quickly like the bobblehead dolls again..Now let’s see who this guy is, said Derek as he crouched down and pulled.the mask from his face.XYFNKWThe man had a shock of thick wild blonde hair..I know this guy, Dillon said in surprise.XYFNKWWell … I don’t know him … I mean I’ve seen him around at the resort..Derek looked at Dillon skeptically.XYFNKWYou’ve seen this guy?XYFNKWhe asked..There’s only roughly five thousand people at the resort, not including the resident population who come in from time to time to use the pool or have dinner in the restaurant, and you remember seeing this guy?Hey man.XYFNKWYou’re the one who says I have gifts of observation.XYFNKWBesides, who.could forget crazy hair like that!Derek conceded the point..And yes … I have seen this guy mingling around the pool when my family.was there.XYFNKWMaybe he’s the one who ransacked my room?Could be, replied Derek.XYFNKWBut for now … His voice trailed off as he pulled out his phone and took a picture of the guy.XYFNKWLet’s see if we know him..Dillon watched as Derek’s phone flipped through a bunch of pictures and.then stopped on this guy.XYFNKWHe is known by The Orion Group, Derek stated..He’s a hired gun.XYFNKWA mercenary..A mercenary?XYFNKWDillon asked..Yes Dillon.XYFNKWA mercenary that is obviously after you.XYFNKWAnd … Derek began.to say but then trailed off as he read more of the data about this guy on his phone..And what?Never mind it’s not important, Derek replied as he put his phone away..Dillon swallowed hard.XYFNKWThis guy must have known you were here with me,.Dillon finally said at length.XYFNKWHow else would he have known we were here except if he followed me?XYFNKWHe would have then seen you and I entering together..And your point is?XYFNKWDerek asked..If he’s some expert then why did he barge in here like a deer in mating season and get caught off-guard?Interesting analogy Dillon.XYFNKWDo you hunt much?I saw a documentary one time, he replied..Derek rolled his eyes.XYFNKWThe one thing you have to learn from this is that not.every ‘expert' is smart, or much of an expert, Derek replied with a chuckle..Besides, you made the difference by running and diving behind the bed at the.right moment.XYFNKWYour sudden movement sparked the chase instinct in him which momentarily blocked his logic centers.XYFNKWAt that moment, for a split second, all he wanted to do was to get you and dismissed any thought of me.XYFNKWThat second was.all I needed..So what you’re saying is that my running away like a scared little rabbit saved the day?XYFNKWDillon sounded confused..Another documentary?XYFNKWDerek asked dryly.XYFNKWNow come on.XYFNKWLet’s finish up.here with John’s stuff.XYFNKWI’ll text a friend of mine to come and clean this up,.Derek stated rather coldly..I thought you were short staffed?Short staffed on field agents, Derek explained.XYFNKWNever mind, he waved his hand dismissively..Dillon swallowed hard.XYFNKWWhat have I gotten myself into?XYFNKWhe thought to.himself.XYFNKWIs this guy dead?XYFNKWhe asked..No.XYFNKWJust knocked out and bleeding a little.XYFNKWMy friend will take him away and see to him..At this point Dillon thought that it was best not to ask anymore questions and.instead he went back over to the hole in the wall and retrieved the backpack..Inside he found what appeared to be regular looking hiking gear: flashlight, lighter, large knife, hatchet, rope, and … a torch.XYFNKWDillon thought that the torch was an odd addition to the gear, but then he remembered in his dream that he was carrying a torch.XYFNKWEven when he first dreamed about it he thought it was weird.XYFNKWWho uses torches in this day and age?XYFNKWBut he just had this feeling that there was something important about it.XYFNKWThe other weird thing he found was a large stone in the top pocket of the back pack.XYFNKWHe looked at it closely as it appeared more metallic than stone.XYFNKWAs he turned it over he got an idea.XYFNKWHe pulled the hidden door shut by the arrowhead.XYFNKWAs soon as it clicked shut the arrowhead.came off the wall.XYFNKWOnce the arrowhead was in Dillon’s hand he opened his palm.and it immediately shot toward the stone and fastened itself there..Ah.XYFNKWA magnet, Derek stated as he came closer, having finished bandaging.the attackers leg and notifying his friend..A really powerful one, Dillon commented.XYFNKWJohn’s a pretty smart guy..Derek leaned in to take a picture of it with his phone when the display started.to fade in and out, appearing as though it was shorting out.XYFNKWHe pulled his phone away and it went back to normal, but he noticed that his battery was now down.to thirty four percent..I think this stone has other properties, Derek said, shaking his head in disgust.XYFNKWHe turned the phone so Dillon could see the screen.XYFNKWI just charged it this morning!XYFNKWBetter keep your electronic devices clear..Dillon nodded, then rummaged through the pack a little more and in one of.the side pockets he pulled out what appeared to be a map.XYFNKWHe unfolded it and immediately recognized it as a map of the Oasis Resort and surrounding area.XYFNKWIt.went as far out as the information center.XYFNKWHe noticed that there were large question marks in about six areas over places around the resort including the amusement park, Resort Hotel, various places in the residential area, and the..information center.XYFNKWAll of the question marks had X’s through them except the one at the Center..I think I know where the entrance is, Dillon said as he looked up at Derek.and smiled..HEY SIS!XYFNKWDILLON HOLLERED AS HE APPROACHED CLAIRE IN FRONT OF THE.mall.XYFNKWShortly after he and Derek left John’s old house he called Claire and arranged a place to meet.XYFNKWThankfully he kept his phone far enough away from the stone when they were at the house so that it didn’t lose too much battery power..How was your sightseeing?XYFNKWClaire asked, appearing to be bored by.Dillon’s pastimes..Oh … it was good.XYFNKWI got to see where the first houses were built, and the old.library, he said trying to play it up.XYFNKWOh yeah!XYFNKWAnd they have this cool fire station!Claire rolled her eyes.XYFNKWLame, she said.XYFNKWYou’re such a weird kid..Maybe, but sometimes weird is exciting, he said, wondering what she.would have thought if she knew the truth about what he was doing..Sure thing.XYFNKWWhatever you say..Dillon just smiled as they walked over to where the bus was going to pick them up again..As they waited in silence he contemplated all the events that had happened.that led up to this point.XYFNKWHe also went over in his head the next stage of the plan..Derek felt that it was best if he took John’s things in order to keep them safe.XYFNKWHe did let Dillon keep the watch and arrowhead however.XYFNKWDillon felt that maybe Derek figured he at least earned that..The plan was for Dillon to sneak out of his room at one in the morning, meet.Derek just outside the resort gate, and head to the information center.XYFNKWIt sounded simple, but Dillon’s stomach was in knots!XYFNKWHe had almost been killed three times now, but hey, who’s counting?XYFNKWHe at least felt more comfortable that Derek was.with him in this.XYFNKWThe guy obviously knew how to handle himself and that gave Dillon some measure of comfort.XYFNKWHe also assured Dillon that he would make sure his room was watched so he didn’t have any run-ins with more goons out to.harm him.XYFNKWHe also guaranteed that his family was safe.XYFNKWThat was the biggest comfort of all for the young boy in the middle of this crazy ride..He had mixed feelings about whether he was doing the right thing in helping.out this Orion Group find John Taylor Sebastian.XYFNKWHe wished he knew who they.were.XYFNKWThat thought nagged at him and made him feel uncomfortable.XYFNKWHe was helping a mysterious organization who apparently operated from the shadows..As he thought about it more he wondered, Am I doing the right thing?..19.E S C A P E F R O M T H E H O T E L.During dinner Claire tried not to make too much eye contact with Mom.and Dad.XYFNKWShe didn’t want to be put into a difficult position about.having to answer questions about her’s and Dillon’s trip to town..So how was town today?XYFNKWMom asked..There it was!XYFNKWThe bomb Claire was trying to avoid..Oh it was great!XYFNKWDillon jumped in.XYFNKWWe saw so many great sights and Claire was really good about it.XYFNKWClaire looked up at him and he smiled back at.her as if to say, I’ve got this.XYFNKWShe thought for sure that he was going to blow it, as he was notoriously not good at keeping things from Mom and Dad..That sounds good, replied Dad.XYFNKWWhat did you like the best?I think the library was probably the best spot, but I’m sure Claire liked the.mall when we got back and had lunch there..Claire nodded.XYFNKWYa, the mall was definitely the best..Well I’m glad the two of you had such a good time, said Dad.XYFNKWAnd thank.you Claire for taking care of your brother.XYFNKWWe appreciate you doing that for us, and I’m sure Dillon does too..Ya thanks sis!XYFNKWDillon said enthusiastically..Claire gave Dillon that look that said, Don’t overdue it.XYFNKWIn truth, it did appear to her that something was changing in her brother she just couldn’t put.her finger on it..Jordan stared hard at his brother and Claire for a moment then resumed his..eating.XYFNKWClaire couldn’t help but feel that Jordan suspected that something was up with the two of them and hoped that he wouldn’t say anything that would cause.Mom and Dad to start probing into their time away.XYFNKWShe was beginning to realize that Jordan wasn’t always your typical shallow sixteen year old boy who.raved about girls, gamed all the time, and was more concerned about how he looked then about anyone else..AFTER DINNER DILLON WENT BACK INTO THE BUSINESS CENTER WITH HIS BOOKS..He was really nervous about the plan he and Derek made to go and find the entrance to the underground caverns of the Oasis and he wanted to do some more reading to make sure he was as prepared as possible.XYFNKWHe cracked open the.book Tom Tom had recommended to him about the creatures of the desert.XYFNKWAfter.flipping through a couple pages he was struck with the creatures he was seeing.in the book and the ones he had encountered so far in real life and in his dreams..He saw the coyotes, spiders, rats, and even snakes.XYFNKWThe ones he had seen in person and in his dreams were obviously different as they had been changed somehow.XYFNKWHe shuddered to think what other monsters they might be creating..Are you Dillon Hunt, came a deep smooth voice, which startled Dillon.XYFNKWHe.jumped a little as he looked up..There, standing in front of him, was an elderly native man with long grey hair that was neatly tied back in a pony tale.XYFNKWHe wore a collared shirt and a silk vest.XYFNKWThe cologne he wore was warmly fragrant and smelled like a summer’s breeze.XYFNKWHe smiled warmly as he looked down at the boy..Ah … ya … that’s me, Dillon replied, not really knowing what to say..Sorry to have startled you.XYFNKWBut my name is Geoffrey Eagles-rock.XYFNKWI’m a friend of Janeen’s..Dillon was frozen.XYFNKWHe didn’t know what to say or do.XYFNKWGeoffrey didn’t say a.word, but let the awkward silence persist.XYFNKWDillon had a feeling that he was enjoying watching the boy squirm..May I sit down?XYFNKWhe finally asked..Ah … sure, Dillon responded..Geoffrey pulled a chair over and sat down.XYFNKWJaneen told me that you were wondering about the symbol we have carved on our wall at the front desk..Dillon didn’t say a word.XYFNKWThe sound of his heart was deafening in his ears..You know Dillon, as I told Janeen, we don’t really know what that symbol.means.XYFNKWBut you know that’s not true don’t you?Dillon didn’t say a word..This isn’t a game, Geoffrey warned.XYFNKWYou need to think about your family.here..Dillon didn’t miss the threat..Besides, Geoffrey continued, how do you know that this Orion Group has.your best interests in mind?XYFNKWYou don’t even know anything about them..Wait.XYFNKWHow do you know about Orion?XYFNKWDillon blurted, not able to think about the implication of his admission of being in contact with Orion..Geoffrey smiled.XYFNKWWe know more than you think we do, he stated coldly.XYFNKWIf.I were you I would consider not going any further with them.XYFNKWOrion will only bring you pain and suffering.XYFNKWAnd I can’t stand to see such young people suffer..Dillon thought about what Geoffrey was telling him, then built up the courage to ask, What did you do with John and Tom Tom?Geoffrey was silent for a moment, then responded, I really don’t know what.you’re talking about.XYFNKWBut if I were you, I would just enjoy the rest of my vacation and forget Orion.XYFNKWThey aren’t what they seem..The aged man stood up and put the chair back where he got it from.XYFNKWYou’re.so young and you have much to live for Dillon.XYFNKWOrion will take those years from.you.XYFNKWThat’s what they do.XYFNKWThey use people and spit them out when they have no.more need for them.XYFNKWBe careful.XYFNKWDespite what you might think, I’m on your side,.and they aren’t..Dillon just sat there dumbfounded about what he was hearing.XYFNKWWas this man.speaking the truth about Orion, or just trying to place doubts in his mind?Well, you have a good night Dillon.XYFNKWI hope you make the right choice,.Geoffrey said as he turned and walked from the room..Dillon sat back, trying to digest what he just heard.XYFNKWWas Orion the bad guy..here?XYFNKWHe truly didn’t know, and that’s what scared him the most..DILLON LAID IN BED LOOKING AT THE WALL.XYFNKWDESPITE GEOFFREY’S WARNING HE.had decided to trust that what he was doing with Derek was the right thing to do..It was a monumental struggle in his mind, but after replaying all the events that had led him to this point he knew that his best option was to see the mission through..He had his back to his brother who was in the other bed beside his.XYFNKWBy all accounts Jordan appeared to be fast asleep.XYFNKWDillon rolled over slowly, trying not to make too much of a stir.XYFNKWHe turned his head and saw that Jordan was laying on his side facing away from him.XYFNKWHe looked at the clock on the stand next to his.bed— it read 12:42 AM.XYFNKWHe knew he had to go right away if he planned to make.it to the rendezvous point with Derek on-time..He pulled the covers off as slowly was he could, not wanting to cause more.of a stir than was necessary.XYFNKWHe was already fully dressed.XYFNKWSomehow he managed.to climb into bed that night without Jordan realizing that he didn’t change into his pyjama’s.XYFNKWHe was actually quite impressed with the feat as he really did put his pj’s on at one point and made sure that Jordan saw him.XYFNKWThen, when Jordan.went to use the restroom just before bed, Dillon quickly shed his pj’s, jammed them under the bed, and put his clothes on again.XYFNKWHe then climbed into bed before Jordan noticed and pretended to drop into a level four coma.XYFNKWIt was ingenious!XYFNKWAt least that’s what he kept telling himself..The fact that Jordan was in such a deep sleep already was amazing, as his brother was a bit of a night-owl.XYFNKWHe originally thought this was going to be a problem, but tonight Jordan drifted off to sleep faster than normal.XYFNKWPerfect!He was really happy at this point that he managed to get a couple hour nap in.after dinner.XYFNKWHe was still feeling the effects of sleep deprivation since being at the resort..Dillon crept around his brother’s bed and peeked at him for a moment, just to.make sure he was out.XYFNKWAll was good.XYFNKWJordan was sleeping like a little baby..Before he went for the door he checked his pockets to ensure that he had the watch and arrowhead.XYFNKWHe then grabbed his shoes in one hand and slowly turned.the lock with the other.XYFNKWAt the end of the rotation the lock made a distinctive.click sound and Dillon froze!XYFNKWHe held his breath.XYFNKWHis brother stirred for just a moment and then all was silent once more.XYFNKWDillon let out his breath in a long slow silent sigh then started to turn the door handle..Once outside he made absolutely sure that he closed the door as quietly as he.could.XYFNKWHe then slipped his shoes on and headed for the stairs.XYFNKWHe was almost there when the door on the other side of the hallway right across from the stairs started to open.XYFNKWIt was his parent’s room!XYFNKWQuickly he launched himself at the door to the stairway, hoping to make it before one of his parents came out and.saw him.XYFNKWAs he went through the door he glanced back to see his Dad looking.down at his phone as he exited his room.XYFNKWIt was at that point that Dillon was extremely happy about living in the age of technology!XYFNKWIt just saved his butt!The doorway to the stairs closed and he darted down as fast as he could go,.not sure if Dad was going to be coming through the stairway as well.XYFNKWHe went.down one floor and stopped, trying to hear if the door he had just come through.was opening.XYFNKWNothing.XYFNKWHe breathed another sigh of relief and continued down to.the main floor..When he got to the door he cracked it open and looked down each side of the.hall.XYFNKWNo one was there.XYFNKWHe knew that the trick was going to be to make it through the lobby without being seen by any of the guest service agents.XYFNKWHe was.also hoping that no one was watching the cameras too closely so as to send out.someone from security to nab him—whether or not they were just doing their job, or were actually part of the conspiracy to stop him and Orion.XYFNKWThe fact that the mercenary from earlier didn’t report back into whoever it was that was behind all this would probably mean that the conspirator’s senses would be heightened.XYFNKWHe had to trust that Derek and Orion were somehow working behind.the scenes in order to execute on the plan..He didn’t feel comfortable trying to find a side entrance at this point and silently berated himself for not doing any recon of the resort before he got to this point.XYFNKWThis problem of the lobby wouldn’t be an issue if he had just been more.diligent in his planning..The lobby was a concern because, at this point, he didn’t know who he could.trust.XYFNKWObviously the head of the resort was in on it to some extent as was evidenced by his talk with Geoffrey..He crept into the hall and toward the lobby.XYFNKWHe peeked around the corner and.didn’t see anyone at all.XYFNKWHe moved into the open space a little and tried to see if anyone was at the front desk.XYFNKWHe saw someone there but they were heading away.from him, going to the far side of the desk.XYFNKWHe inched a little more into the lobby and then heard the distinctive ring of the elevator as it reached the main floor..His heart began to pound.XYFNKWHe quickly ran across the main area and ducked behind the fountain before the door opened..He heard someone come into the lobby from the elevator hallway and start talking to the guy manning the front desk.XYFNKWHe knew from the voice that it was his Dad!XYFNKWHe peeked around the fountain and saw him talking with the guest services.agent..What’s Dad doing down here so late?XYFNKWDillon thought to himself.XYFNKWHe strained to hear the conversation but couldn’t make out what they were talking about..Then he noticed that his Dad had his laptop with him and was showing it to the.guest services guy.XYFNKWIt looked like he was trying to deal with a technical issue or something..Thankfully the conversation didn’t take long and Dad seemed pleased with the answers he must have received from the man, as he shook his hand and headed back to the elevator.XYFNKWThe agent started to walk to the end of the desk again and bent down, as if trying to retrieve something.XYFNKWDillon knew that this was his only chance.XYFNKWHe darted out from behind the fountain and sprinted as quietly as he could to the rotating front door of the hotel..He burst through the door and onto the main strip that housed the resort and.the numerous shops that catered to the tourists.XYFNKWDillon hadn’t been out this late at night before and was surprised to see that the shops were still open and people, mostly adults, mingled about taking in all the lights and attractions.XYFNKWHe heard music coming from down the strip and saw some sort of electric light show happening.XYFNKWThe restaurant that was across from the hotel turned into an energetic.dance club and now had a sign at the front door which read: No Minors Allowed..Dillon had to shake his head a little in order to comprehend the scene.XYFNKWThe.transformation of the strip seemed surreal to him.XYFNKWIt also made him wonder if Jordan had snuck out any of the previous nights to check out the attractions?This would totally have been his scene!He couldn’t dwell on those thoughts anymore as he knew that time was quickly fading away.XYFNKWDespite all the foot traffic on the boulevard he still had a sense that he didn’t want to be seen by anyone or any camera if possible.XYFNKWHe tried not to look too conspicuous as he walked across the street and then, when.he thought no one was looking, he darted into the trees.XYFNKWHe crept through the tall stalks staying in their shadows as he moved toward the front gate.XYFNKWIt was good.that the resort property didn’t have a wall around it, just the trees and other shrubs that added to the beauty of the place.XYFNKWIt was also good that the front gate was a ways away from all the action..As he approached the gate building he noticed a light on inside.XYFNKWSlowly he came to the side of the building right under the window.XYFNKWHe carefully rose up and peeked inside.XYFNKWHe scanned the area and didn’t see anyone.XYFNKWHe was about to move.on when he noticed a door on the inside swing open and he heard the sound of a.toilet flush.XYFNKWThe sudden movement of the door startled him and he ducked back.down below the window.XYFNKWAfter a moment he dared to glance back over the windowsill again.XYFNKWUnfortunately the window was open and the smell of the restroom hit him.XYFNKWHe silently gaged but managed to hold it in.XYFNKWOnce the water from his eyes cleared he noticed a middle-aged man reclining easily in a large chair.XYFNKWHe had a 42 screen TV mounted on the wall and was scrolling through the Netflix selections..Dillon wasn’t sure how distracted the guard was but didn’t want to take any.chances he knew he couldn’t get caught.XYFNKWHe looked around on the ground and.found the largest stone he could.XYFNKWIt was about the size of small apple.XYFNKWHe peeked through the window once more and saw that the guard was still surfing for something to watch.XYFNKWHe ducked back down and scooted around to the side of the.guard house closest to the road.XYFNKWAs he glanced around the corner he noticed that.the door was open.XYFNKWPerfect!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWHe lobbed the stone toward the entrance.XYFNKWIt hit the ground with a crack and rolled into the night.XYFNKWQuickly, Dillon ducked back around the corner and peeked through the window again..The guard didn’t show any signs that he noticed anything..This guy must be deaf!XYFNKWhe exclaimed to himself, as the night was incredibly quiet, and the TV wasn’t playing anything yet..As he was pondering his circumstance the guard suddenly got up.XYFNKWDillon ducked beneath the windowsill again.XYFNKWHe could hear the heavy footfalls of the man’s boots on the wood floor.XYFNKWReally!XYFNKWI can hear his boots and he couldn’t hear that rock!XYFNKWDillon shouted in his head..The footsteps were getting closer to the window.XYFNKWDillon put his back against.the wall as flat as he could, then started to move toward the corner of the building again as quietly as possible..He looked both ways when he got to the road, and glanced back just to make.sure the guard wasn’t sticking his head out the open window.XYFNKWAll was clear.XYFNKWHe.looked up to see where the cameras were mounted and figured that he might be.able to stay in a blind spot if he stuck close to the wall..He could feel his heart pound within his chest as he moved around the corner.and toward the open door.XYFNKWAs he got to the door he poked his head through the.opening for a second and saw that the guard was still at the window, probably getting some fresh air.XYFNKWHe knew he had to move.XYFNKWHe sucked in his breath and darted across the doorway and around the corner of the building as quickly and.quietly as he could.XYFNKWHe didn’t even stop to see if the guard had noticed anything as he ran into the darkness once more..He moved up the road through the trees, trying to avoid all the street lights as he went.XYFNKWHe must have gone about three hundred yards before he saw Derek’s car parked off the side of the road and into the tree line a bit.XYFNKWAs he approached he noticed that Derek was standing about ten feet in front of the car.XYFNKWHe walked back and forth with his phone to his ear and waved his other hand around as he.spoke to whoever it was.XYFNKWIt almost looked like he was angry, or maybe frustrated about something..Dillon went passed the car and approached Derek, not trying to be stealthy.anymore.XYFNKWDerek spun around quickly, grabbed his gun from behind his back and pointed it right at Dillon, all while still holding the phone to his ear..Dillon jumped back and held his hands up reflexively.XYFNKWWhoa!XYFNKWhe yelled..It’s just me!Derek smiled and lowered the gun.XYFNKWI have to go, he said into the phone..Dillon could hear someone on the other end but couldn’t make out what they were saying.XYFNKWI understand, came Derek’s reply.XYFNKWDon’t worry.XYFNKWWe’ll make it happen.XYFNKWThe boy’s here now.XYFNKWBye.XYFNKWHe took the phone away from his ear and hung up from whoever it was..Who’s that?XYFNKWDillon asked..Just someone who’s interested in our success tonight, Derek replied as he.came closer to his young friend.XYFNKWDid you bring the watch and arrowhead..Dillon nodded as he produced them from his pocket..Awesome.XYFNKWI have a feeling that those are going to come in handy tonight..What about John’s field gear?XYFNKWDillon asked..It’s in the car..Good, because I have a feeling that we’re going to need that bag tonight as well, Dillon responded.XYFNKWHe had already reasoned that John packed the gear for.his excursion under the Oasis an excursion that never took place..Come on, Derek said.XYFNKWHe motioned for Dillon to get in the car.XYFNKWWe should.be going as we can’t waste any more time..Before we do, you should know that earlier tonight a man name Geoffrey Eagles-rock paid me a visit tonight and tried to convince me that the Orion Group is not to be trusted.XYFNKWHe said that you guys are using me, and that no good will come to me if I help you..Then why did you come?XYFNKWDerek asked..Because I have faith that you’re telling me the truth.XYFNKWEverything that’s happened to me up to this point is telling me that there’s something bad happening here and that you guys seem to be the only ones willing to do anything about it..It sounds like this Geoffrey guy is scared of you Dillon..Dillon was taken back by that statement.XYFNKWScared of me?XYFNKWWhy?Because they see that you are a threat to them.XYFNKWAnd now that you’re working with us, it’s just a matter of time before we really find out what they’re up to..But I’m only a twelve year old boy!XYFNKWDillon spouted.XYFNKWHow could I be scary.to anyone?Yes.XYFNKWA remarkable twelve year old, Derek replied with a smile.XYFNKWYou might.not think so now Dillon, but you’re destined for something greater..How do you know that?There’s just something about you that tells me that, Derek replied.cryptically as he opened the door to the car.XYFNKWYou might not believe it, but someday you will.XYFNKWNow, shall we go?Dillon didn’t know how to respond.XYFNKWHe thought that maybe Derek was just trying to be nice.XYFNKWKind of like those people who just say good stuff about you but might not mean it they’re just trying to be positive but have nothing logical to back it up with.XYFNKWHe let the thought drop and climbed into the car..As they headed down the road toward the information center they didn’t know what to expect, if anything.XYFNKWIn a few minutes they knew they would find.out.XYFNKWIt was that anticipation of the unknown that had Dillon nervous.XYFNKWHis stomach was in knots.XYFNKWHe looked over at Derek and saw a man who appeared focused on one task and one task only: to find out what happened to John..Dillon had this strange feeling, as the hairs on the back of his neck stood up,.that the only thing that would stop Derek was death itself..He really hoped it didn’t come down to that....20.A N E N C O U N T E R W I T H A S N A K E.The first few seconds of the trip were quiet as Derek and Dillon kept.their thoughts to themselves..So … how was your day?XYFNKWDillon asked, trying to break the.silence..Derek just smiled and kept his eyes forward, not saying a word..Do you like being an agent for a secret organization?Silence..Dillon looked around for something to fidget with as Derek didn’t seem to be.in a talkative mood.XYFNKWHe was trying his hardest to break the awkward silence but.was failing miserably..He didn’t really know this guy and now he was in a car with him heading out.to do who-knew-what as they really didn’t know what to expect.XYFNKWIt was weird though.XYFNKWDillon just had this feeling that he could trust Derek and he didn’t know why.XYFNKWIt was the same kind of feeling he had when he knew that the watch was.important somehow but could not explain how he knew that.XYFNKWOr the feeling he had with the arrowhead, and when he just knew he had to hide the watch and the.arrowhead in his room which saved them from being discovered when his room.was searched.XYFNKWIn each of these circumstances his gut had been right..Maybe his trust in the man showed his naiveté as he was only twelve and didn’t have much life experience yet?XYFNKWNo, he reasoned.XYFNKWThere was something else.XYFNKWAt least he hoped his feelings were accurate because this is how kids ended.up going missing!XYFNKWMaybe Derek was going to take him and sell him as a child laborer somewhere he thought.XYFNKWHe laughed inside.XYFNKWThere were easier ways to steal a kid then to fabricate some fanciful tale of working for a secret organization who is trying to help a member of theirs who had disappeared.XYFNKWNot.to mention Derek saving his life.XYFNKWNo.XYFNKWHe believed that Derek was telling the truth and that the man did need his help finding John.XYFNKWDillon pushed all the unpleasant thoughts aside and rehearsed all the weird stuff that had happened up to this point which confirmed Derek’s story..So I’ve been meaning to ask you something but I keep forgetting, Dillon piped up at last as he produced the small metal object he found when the coyote.burst into flames in front of him.XYFNKWWhat’s this?Derek took it from Dillon’s hand and glanced at it.XYFNKWI don’t know.XYFNKWWhere did.you find it?It came out of one of those creatures that attacked me at the center..How did you get it?I found it in the pile of ash after it burned up.XYFNKWI figured it would be important, or at least a clue of something, but I haven’t been able to find out what it is or what it does..Derek looked equally as puzzled as he handed it back to Dillon.XYFNKWThere are.more than enough mysteries happening here that we need to crack, he said soberly..Dillon nodded as he placed it back in his pocket..So how did you get involved with The Orion Group?XYFNKWDillon asked, trying.to pry more information out of his new friend.XYFNKWAnd now that Derek was actually.speaking he thought he would capitalize on the opportunity for him to learn more..Derek was silent for a moment.XYFNKWIt’s a long story Dillon, he said cryptically..Dillon figured that it was probably a good idea to leave it at that.XYFNKWHe was sure that Derek would open up to him when he felt he wanted to and not a moment.before..So … do you have a family?XYFNKWDillon asked, thinking that the question was.innocent enough and less invasive..Derek glanced over at him and then looked to the road again without saying a word..Sorry, but I get talkative when I’m nervous..It’s gonna be okay Dillon, Derek reassured, not even looking over at him..I’ll do everything I can to keep you safe.XYFNKWAs a matter of fact, when we find the entrance I don’t want you coming in with me.XYFNKWAfter I’m finished what I need to.do, I’ll take you back to the resort..Dillon liked the man’s confidence, but didn’t like the suggestion that Derek.didn’t want him seeing it through to the end.XYFNKWBut … he stammered..No Dillon!XYFNKWDerek said as he raised his voice.XYFNKWYour job ends when we find.the entrance..He immediately calmed.XYFNKWYou’ve done well.XYFNKWVery well.XYFNKWBetter than anyone could have expected, but I can’t have you risking your life anymore..But I’m still in danger, Dillon argued..Not if I can neutralize the aggressor.XYFNKWThat should give you peace of mind..Dillon thought of a hundred good arguments about why he should go with Derek but realized that they would be of no use.XYFNKWInstead, he sat silently for the rest of the drive.XYFNKWWhen they arrived, Derek turned off his headlights before he came to a stop in front of the center..As the two of them got out the first thing they noticed was the stillness in the air.XYFNKWThere was no wind and there weren’t any clouds in the sky.XYFNKWThe stars shone.brightly.XYFNKWHere, practically in the middle of nowhere, the sky burst to life with sparkling light.XYFNKWDillon always marvelled at the sereneness of it all.XYFNKWHe looked back toward the resort and saw the lights shining on the horizon..He was suddenly brought back to reality, however, with the far off sound of a.coyote.XYFNKWHe shivered slightly.XYFNKWHe knew that those coyotes out there at that moment were most likely not the demonic kind that tried to kill him a few days.earlier but the sound of them nonetheless sent a chill down his spine..Derek went to the trunk, opened it up, and slung John’s backpack onto one of.his shoulders.XYFNKWAfter we find the entrance I’m going to need the compass..Dillon looked at him curiously at first then clued in—the watch with its accompanying arrowhead.XYFNKWDerek smiled when he saw the lights go on in.Dillon’s head.XYFNKWCome on, he said as he started moving across the street toward the center.XYFNKWDillon followed close behind..When they got to the door Derek pulled out his phone tapped one of the apps.on it and then reached in his pocket for a short cord that had a key-looking thing on the end of it.XYFNKWHe plugged the key into the door and the other end into his phone.XYFNKWDillon watched and marvelled.XYFNKWIn a moment the alarm system was shut down and the lock turned open..That’s awesome!XYFNKWDillon whispered a little louder than he meant to.XYFNKWHow.can I get an app like that?XYFNKWhe asked a little quieter..It’s standard issue, replied Derek with a smirk..Just like the other device you used on John’s house?XYFNKWDillon asked with a smile.XYFNKWI’m starting to like this Orion Group, he said in admiration.XYFNKWHey why.didn’t you use that other device on this door?That one won’t work on this type of lock, he replied as he cracked the door.open and he and Dillon slipped inside.XYFNKWHe then reached in his pocket and pulled.out a small flashlight and started to look around cautiously.XYFNKWAll seemed normal..Try to be as quiet as you can, he whispered to Dillon as he drew out his hand.gun.XYFNKWJust because the place looks empty doesn’t mean it is.XYFNKWTrust me.XYFNKWI’ve had a ton of experience with this stuff..Dillon swallowed hard as he followed Derek through the maze of.merchandise to the back hallway.XYFNKWAs they moved through the place Dillon spotted a 360 degree security camera staring at them from the ceiling.XYFNKWHe tugged on Derek’s arm and pointed it out..Don’t worry, said Derek in hushed tones.XYFNKWIt’s stuck on the images which.were being filmed just before we opened the door..Another app?Yup..That’s cool!Derek smiled for a moment then turned cold-faced as he continued through.the center.XYFNKWJust in case you’re wondering, we’re heading to the back room first because that’s where you said Tom Tom disappeared from.XYFNKWThat’s probably the.most likely spot for an entrance to an underground lair.XYFNKWDillon just knew that.Derek’s years of training and self-discipline must have been kicking in as he was probably beginning to expect the worst.XYFNKWDillon understood the logic of his reasoning clearly and followed closely behind..They made it to the back room without incident.XYFNKWIt was pretty much the same.as it was the last time Dillon had seen it nothing was out of the ordinary.XYFNKWI’m sure the entrance is in here somewhere, Derek said as he turned to Dillon..Let’s fan out and look around..Dillon nodded, not wanting to appear scared.XYFNKWThe truth was that he was terrified!XYFNKWHe had already been attacked once by creatures that seemed demonic.and wasn’t interested in going through that again.XYFNKWNevertheless he steeled his nerves, pulled out his phone, turned on the light, and took the opposite side of the room from Derek..Just yell if you see something, Derek said as he moved behind some boxes..Dillon searched the wall area first then started to move into the inside.XYFNKWHe could hear Derek move boxes and racks out of the way as he looked.XYFNKWThey both.searched for what seemed to be a long while.XYFNKWIn reality it was less than fifteen minutes..See anything yet?XYFNKWasked Derek from the darkness..No.XYFNKWYou?Nothing.XYFNKWThere has to be a hidden door or something here somewhere,.Derek said.XYFNKWHis tone starting to edge toward frustration.XYFNKWLet’s move some of these boxes around and take a thorough look..Derek met Dillon in the middle and they started moving the boxes out of the.way and looking more closely at the floor.XYFNKWDillon was down on his knees trying.to discern whether or not there were edges to a door or something when a thought struck him.XYFNKWHe pulled out the watch and arrowhead, attached them, and.waited to see what happened.XYFNKWAt first the arrow head kept pointing toward Derek..Hey Derek.XYFNKWAre you still carrying that stone from John’s backpack?Derek nodded..Let’s take it out for a moment and chuck it as far as you can to the other side of the room..Why?XYFNKWDerek asked..I have a hunch that this stone comes from somewhere below the Oasis and.that John knew it could lead him to the entrance, but we won’t know if that stone is anywhere near the arrowhead as that’s all it’s picking up.XYFNKWSo I’m thinking—.That there’s probably another magnetic field close by that will pull on the arrowhead which should lead us to the entrance, Derek finished..Exactly!That’s ingenious Dillon!XYFNKWDerek pulled the rock out of the pack and tossed.it as far as he could to the entrance where they entered the room.XYFNKWThe arrowhead followed the stone at first and then spun around in the opposite direction.XYFNKWDillon smiled widely.XYFNKWHe got up and started following the needle.XYFNKWIt pointed generally at the back wall and then started to angle toward the corner.XYFNKWDerek joined him and the two of them kept following it until they came to a stop at the corner of the building..They immediately started feeling the wall for a door way, hatch, or.something that would open up but there was nothing.XYFNKWDerek shone his light all up and down the wall in desperation but couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary..It’s useless, he said finally.XYFNKWMaybe John was wrong about his suspicion..Or maybe not, replied Dillon as he moved toward Derek who had stepped.away from the wall.XYFNKWDillon looked closely at Derek’s shoulder where he had slung the pack.XYFNKWDerek looked back at him curiously trying to discern where he was staring..Dillon reached up and touched a loose thread on the bag that was apparently.wavering in the breeze.XYFNKWBut they were inside and there shouldn’t be any breeze.except from an air conditioning unit and the air conditioning vent was on the other side of the room.XYFNKWDerek looked down and saw it as well.XYFNKWDillon followed.the direction of where he thought the breeze was coming from.XYFNKWHe put his hand.to the floor and moved it ever-so-slightly along.XYFNKWNothing seemed to be out of the ordinary.XYFNKWThen, out of the corner of his eye he saw the needle on the watch-compass spinning in circles..He felt around on the floor with more determination until he felt it.XYFNKWThere.was a light breeze coming up from between one of the seams in the tile flooring..Feel this!XYFNKWDillon exclaimed..Derek put his hand to the floor and felt the same light breeze coming up from.somewhere below.XYFNKWThey exchanged knowing looks.XYFNKWThere’s an open space.down there, Derek said excitedly..Ya, but where’s the latch?The tile had lots of grooves and smooth rock formations all over it.XYFNKWAs Dillon.moved his hand slowly along its surface he felt an unnatural depression in part of the stone that appeared to be carved out with a tool or something.XYFNKWIt was a little bigger than the size of a finger.XYFNKWHe pushed down a little on it and felt it depress like it was under tension.XYFNKWWhen he removed his finger the piece of tile sprung back up to be flush with the rest of the stone..He looked up at Derek.XYFNKWYou might want to step back, he said, a serious expression splayed across his face..Derek complied without even a word.XYFNKWDillon pushed down on the tile button..A loud click was heard and then a large square section of the tile gave way and.swung down—being hinged on one side—to reveal a dark hole.XYFNKWImmediately they could feel a rush of air enter the room from the corridor below.XYFNKWThis must have been how they grabbed Tom Tom..Derek patted Dillon on the back.XYFNKWGood job kid.XYFNKWNow let’s see where this thing goes, he said, pulling the backpack off his shoulder and kneeling at the edge of the hole..Dillon looked into the dark passageway, a chill going up his back..Alright kid.XYFNKWI’ll see you in a bit if all goes well, Derek said as he held his hand out indicating that he needed the watch and arrowhead.XYFNKWDillon was about to.hand it over when they suddenly heard a low hissing sound coming from somewhere in the direction of the entrance to the room..What was that?XYFNKWDillon blurted..They spun around and saw something moving through the merchandise,.toppling boxes, and knocking over racks.XYFNKWDerek pulled his gun.XYFNKWBoth he and Dillon shone their lights in the direction trying to discern what was coming at them.XYFNKWWhatever it was, it was getting closer.XYFNKWWe know you’re there!XYFNKWCome.out!XYFNKWDerek screamed..The hissing was getting louder..Get behind me Dillon!XYFNKWDerek yelled.XYFNKWDillon didn’t have to be asked twice..Out of the darkness a large snakelike creature emerged, towering about seven.feet.XYFNKWIt had a large head, yellow glowing eyes, and two thick arms riddled with.scales and ending in three clawed fingers..Dillon’s face went pale, but Derek steeled his look and tightened his stance..He fired two shots into the creatures torso.XYFNKWIt appeared to sting the beast as it recoiled slightly.XYFNKWThen it whipped it’s head around and lunged..Derek pushed Dillon out of the way as he dove to the other side.XYFNKWHe crashed.into the wall, while Dillon skidded across the floor, scraping his knees and elbows on the rough tile..The creature had dived passed the two and was already turning for another strike.XYFNKWIt was about to pounce at Dillon when suddenly the lights to the room came on.XYFNKWThe creature recoiled at the brightness.XYFNKWDerek shot it again.XYFNKWIt flinched and hissed at him but turned toward Dillon.XYFNKWIt launched at him, pushing itself with its strong tail.XYFNKWDillon knew he didn’t have time to get clear and thought that this was the last thing he would ever see.XYFNKWThe snake-thing was about to grab him with its thick arms when Dillon felt himself flying through the air to the side as something tackled him.XYFNKWHe hit the floor again forcefully, the wind being blasted from his lungs.XYFNKWHe struggled, unsure of what flew into him when he noticed that.his brother Jordan was on top of him..What?XYFNKWhe yelled in confusion..You just gonna let that thing get you, you dork?XYFNKWJordan yelled at him..Dillon didn’t know what to think.XYFNKWIt seemed surreal that Jordan was here but.he didn’t have time to process it.XYFNKWHe noticed Derek run up beside him and his brother, gun in one hand and his combat knife in the other.XYFNKWBang!XYFNKWAnother shot.rang out..The creature responded by swiping Derek across the chest with its claws..Derek grunted as three lines of blood appeared on his shirt.XYFNKWBy this time Dillon and Jordan were back up on their feet.XYFNKWDerek shot again and wheeled around to.the brothers.XYFNKWHe dropped John’s pack at their feet.XYFNKWTake it and go!XYFNKWhe yelled at.them..Dillon hesitated.XYFNKWTake it!XYFNKWhe yelled again as he turned back and barely ducked another strike from the beast..Dillon scooped it up quickly and moved to the side where the hole in the floor was.XYFNKWJordan grabbed his arm.XYFNKWWhere are you going?We don’t have time, Dillon responded emphatically glancing over Jordan.for a moment to see Derek engaged with the creature..Jordan glanced back then turned toward Dillon.XYFNKWI see what you mean..The snake noticed the two brothers as it backhanded Derek aside.XYFNKWThe man.flew into some boxes and toppled a couple of clothing racks.XYFNKWDillon locked eyes.with the thing for a moment.XYFNKWHe knew it was going to strike.XYFNKWGo!XYFNKWhe yelled to.his brother..Jordan leaped into the dark hole..The snake launched at Dillon just as he jumped in behind his brother.XYFNKWThe clawed hand ripped through the air just above the boy’s head as he descended into the darkness..Dillon hit the ground hard and almost started to tumble down what seemed to.be stairs, but managed to catch himself.XYFNKWHe noticed that Jordan wasn’t there and heard some faint grunts coming from down the staircase.XYFNKWHe looked up and saw.the snake peering into the hole.XYFNKWIt looked as though it was going to try and climb down.XYFNKWIts head started to slither through when suddenly it was hit by something..It hissed as though it was in pain and pushed away from the hole.XYFNKWDillon flinched, which caused him to lose his footing and he started to tumble down the stairs into the darkness.XYFNKWHe tried to stop his descent but couldn’t get a hold of anything to help and the stairs were way too steep..As he tumbled into the darkness he could hear more shots ring out from the.room above.XYFNKWThose eventually drowned out as he rolled and slid deeper into the.gloom....21.I N T O T H E D A R K N E S S.The two brothers screamed as they bounced and slid, slid and bounced..Fortunately for them the stairs seemed to be coated with some sort of.fungus which cushioned their rapid descent more than it would have if.it was just bare stone.XYFNKWThey slid for what seemed forever and then were spit out at the bottom into a large room.XYFNKWThey rolled and then came to a stop.XYFNKWNeither of them wanted to get up and just laid there looking at the ceiling..The room had a small glow to it.XYFNKWDillon could feel the sweat form on the palms of his hands.XYFNKWHe started to breathe a little heavier as he took in his surroundings familiarity to them struck him like lightening as he knew these were the same images from his dreams—his nightmares..He slowly climbed to his feet and tried to shake the dirt from his clothes..Jordan was up as well and came storming over to him..You better tell me what’s going on right now little bro!XYFNKWhe yelled as he came right up to Dillon and grabbed him by one of the straps on his pack..Dillon tried to pull away but Jordan’s grasp was too much.XYFNKWOkay okay, he.said, trying to calm his brother down.XYFNKWJordan let go.XYFNKWHe was about to answer when a curious expression came across his face..How did you know where I was?XYFNKWhe asked.XYFNKWAnd how did you get to the.center anyway?I’m not telling you anything until you start talking!XYFNKWJordan let go and shoved Dillon back..Dillon paused for a moment trying to collect his thoughts.XYFNKWOkay, okay, he said, patting his hands in the air trying to get Jordan to calm down.XYFNKWWell … a.man named John Taylor Sebastian went missing about a year and a half ago as.he was investigating the source of the Oasis’s rejuvenating power..And this friend of yours?XYFNKWJordan asked..He apparently works for the group who wanted John and his team to find the answer to this mystery.XYFNKWThis group that he works for—The Orion Group—.are the ones who staged Dad to get the trip here..What!XYFNKWWhy would they do that?Dillon paused, trying to think of the best way to explain it to Jordan without.sounding like a total crackpot..Well—?XYFNKWJordan’s frustration began to be more evident as Dillon didn’t immediately answer..Because they think that I have some abilities that will be able to help them..He knew it sounded stupid but it was the truth.XYFNKWThere it was.XYFNKWHe was now officially a crackpot!What kind of abilities?XYFNKWasked Jordan skeptically..I notice things, replied Dillon cryptically.XYFNKWGreat!XYFNKWThat sounded even stupider!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWI don’t know how to explain it, but I observe things that others don’t..Jordan looked at him without saying a word, then smirked.XYFNKWSure you do, he.said sarcastically.XYFNKWThere must have been some kind of mistake with this Orion.Group drafting you.XYFNKWI mean … you’re only twelve!XYFNKWYou can barely look after yourself let alone help some secret organization find a missing person.XYFNKWIt’s like believing that I can shoot lasers out of my butt!Believe what you want then, Dillon said with a dismissive wave..Jordan was silent for a moment.XYFNKWSorry man.XYFNKWI’m just confused about all this..It’s a lot to process.XYFNKWHow about you use your special abilities and get us outa here.XYFNKWAnd we’re not going back up there!XYFNKWhe said, indicating the stairs they rolled down..No you don’t, Dillon replied.XYFNKWIt’s your turn now.XYFNKWWe’re not going.anywhere until you tell me how you are even here!Jordan shrugged as if it was no big deal.XYFNKWI knew you were up to something ever since I saw you talking to your friend when we were at the amusement park..Then there was your reaction to me when I came out of the haunted house..Dillon blushed a little..I definitely knew something weird was going on then.XYFNKWIt wasn’t like you to.act that way.XYFNKWAnd when you and Claire went to town I tracked your phone and.cross-referenced it with google maps.XYFNKWYou were nowhere near the library..Wow, Dillon said, impressed by his brothers ingenuity.XYFNKWWhy didn’t you tell Mom and Dad?Jordan snorted.XYFNKWThat’s not what brothers do bro.XYFNKWBesides, I figured you had.your reasons for sneaking around.XYFNKWI just didn’t think it was this, he said with a wave of the hand displaying their immediate surroundings.XYFNKWAnd … he started.to say with a mischievous smile..And what?XYFNKWDillon asked..And there might be a time in the future when I need a favor from you, which I am sure you will be more than happy to help with now that I know your.‘secrets.’.Dillon paused, digesting what his brother was implying.XYFNKWHe realized now that, despite his earlier heroics, Jordan was still the same old Jordan: always trying to get something out of him..Okay, okay, I get it, he resigned.XYFNKWI just still don’t get how you got here?Oh yeah … said Jordan, almost as though he had forgotten where he was.in his story.XYFNKWSo because I knew you were lying about your’s and Claire’s excursion to town I thought I would keep a closer eye on you for the next while and it’s a good thing I did.XYFNKWSo after you left the room I followed you to your meeting spot with your friend, snuck into the back of the car, and voila … here I am!XYFNKWhe said, brimming with pride..But how did you get passed Dad?XYFNKWDillon asked, his curiosity peaked..Well that was the strange thing.XYFNKWI waited for Dad to get in the elevator and.then went down the staircase on the opposite end of the hallway because I thought that’s the one you took.XYFNKWBut when I got to the side door and outside the hotel I didn’t see you anywhere.XYFNKWI honestly didn’t think you would try to sneak.out through the lobby!Dillon blushed, remembering his lack of reconnoissance which forced him to.go through the lobby..I was about to head back inside, thinking that I missed you when I saw you.head down the street through the crowd and into the tree line, Jordan continued..I followed you through the trees, around the guard house and, when you were.having a conversation with your friend up there, I snuck into the back of the car...Wow, Dillon said again.XYFNKWThat’s quite the story.XYFNKWI didn’t think you were that observant, he said with a smirk.XYFNKWYou’ve really impressed me big bro..Ya, I’ve been known to surprise people from time to time.XYFNKWNot just a dumb.teenager am I?XYFNKWhe said with a smile..Before Dillon could respond Jordan’s face suddenly took on a deadly serious.demeanour.XYFNKWThat’s not the most interesting part of the story though, he said, looking Dillon in the eyes.XYFNKWJust before I managed to get to the door, while I was still climbing out of the car, I saw a van pull up in front.XYFNKWDillon’s heart skipped a beat.XYFNKWBefore I knew what was going on, someone got out and opened the back.door to the van and out came that snake-thing from upstairs.XYFNKWThankfully, whoever that was, didn’t see me.XYFNKWHe opened the door to the center and let the creature inside, then went back and sat in the van.XYFNKWI texted you to get out of there, but you didn’t respond..Dillon pulled out his phone, but the battery was dead.XYFNKWI guess I missed it..Dillon shuddered as he thought about the creature again, and how Derek was.still up there with it.XYFNKWHow did you get in here then with the van out front?Dillon asked..As soon as he went back into the van I got out of the car and snuck up beside it.XYFNKWI got a glimpse of his reflection from the mirror and noticed that he was preoccupied with looking at an iPad or something.XYFNKWI figured that he was too.busy to notice me so I rushed inside as quickly and quietly as possible.XYFNKWI heard the commotion in the back room as soon as I got inside and ran there as fast as I could—and it’s a good thing I did!I’ll say, Dillon agreed.XYFNKWI’d be snake chow right now if you hadn’t gotten.here when you did..At this point Dillon knew it would be wise not to tell Jordan about his dreams, even though they seemed to be living one of those right now..They both looked around trying to take in their surroundings for the first time since they came crashing down the stairs.XYFNKWThey appeared to be in a naturally shaped cave.XYFNKWThe room was squarish with a tall ceiling that was about.ten feet high.XYFNKWThey could only make out a little of what they saw from the strangely glowing fungi that clung to the ceiling and walls.XYFNKWThe absolute silence of the place was eery..Dillon reached in the backpack and pulled out the flashlight.XYFNKWAs he shone it.around the room he just knew that this was the very same place he had seen in.his dreams..Okay.XYFNKWThere should be another hall, tunnel, or something like that out of this room over here, Dillon said as he flashed the light in the direction, walked passed his brother, and headed to the other side of the chamber..Right—your ‘special ability’ told you that, mocked Jordan.XYFNKWAs he followed.he pulled out his phone thinking to see if he had any bars and also to engage his flashlight function..That won’t work, Dillon said as he noticed what Jordan was trying to do..What— he started to respond then noticed that his battery was dead.XYFNKWHow.did you know that?Lucky guess, Dillon replied.XYFNKWJordan stowed his phone again and came to stand beside his brother.XYFNKWDillon found the tunnel he was talking about without any issues, but before they entered it he quickly went over to the far wall and shined his light right where he knew the symbol on the wall would be.XYFNKWSure enough it was there.XYFNKWThe back of the hairs on Dillon’s neck stuck out and a shiver went down his spine..Jordan looked to the symbol then back to Dillon.XYFNKWWhat is it?XYFNKWhe asked..I don’t know.XYFNKWIt keeps showing up so I can’t help but think that it’s important somehow.XYFNKWDillon noticed that the writing he saw around the symbol.in his dream was missing again..Jordan was quiet as Dillon pondered its meaning for a moment..Okay we should get going, Dillon finally said after trying to process what was happening to him.XYFNKWHe was scared.XYFNKWBut he knew he had to stay strong and see.this through.XYFNKWHe wondered why he was only able to get glimpses of some of the.events in his dream, and whether or not they were actually future events, like some sort of premonition, or if it was all just a coincidence.XYFNKWSomething was unnerving here.XYFNKWHe also wondered if Gwen would fit into all of this?XYFNKWMaybe his.dreams were only images of what might happen, not necessarily what will happen?Before they went into the tunnel he gave Jordan the flashlight and took out a.torch and lighter.XYFNKWDillon dug around for a moment and produced a small bottle of something that was in the bag.XYFNKWIt was marked oil.XYFNKWHe unstoppered it and put a.bit of the oil on the cloth that was entwined on the end of the torch.XYFNKWThen he sparked the lighter and lit it up.XYFNKWIt was surprisingly bright for an old fashioned tool..Who uses torches nowadays!XYFNKWJordan exclaimed as the dry stick came to life..Someone who knows that electronics aren’t going to be very useful down here, Dillon answered, as he pulled out a hunting knife from the bag before slinging it back on his shoulders again.XYFNKWHe reached into his pocket and produced the makeshift compass.XYFNKWThe arrowhead needle was stuck in a constant state of spin..Where’d you get that?XYFNKWJordan asked, bending lower to get a better look at.it..It used to be John Taylor Sebastian’s.XYFNKWDillon examined it more.XYFNKWI think he has it somehow locked on locating the specific magnetism that’s in these rocks..I’m not sure how it works, but because of this little watch we were able to find this place.XYFNKWUnfortunately, I don’t think it’s going to be of any more help down here.XYFNKWDillon held it up for his brother to see more clearly.XYFNKWJordan watched as the compass spun and spun and spun..I guess everything down here is radiating that stuff, Jordan concluded..Dillon nodded..Come on, we have to keep moving, Dillon said as he started down the.passage.XYFNKWHe suddenly stopped after a few steps and looked back at Jordan.XYFNKWAnd just so you know, there are creatures down here too, he said cryptically as he handed his brother the knife he pulled from the bag..Jordan stared at Dillon with a stunned expression and his body visibly shuddered.XYFNKWHe grabbed the knife and nodded grimly as he followed his brother.into the darkness....22.S P I D E R S.The only thing that the two brothers could hear as they walked slowly.down the passageway was the sound of their own steps, and the.crackle of the torch as the flame burned on.XYFNKWDillon waved the torch.from side to side as he walked, trying to illuminate the long tunnel as much as he could.XYFNKWJordan also moved the flashlight around trying to get better views as he went.XYFNKWAfter about twenty feet into the tunnel they came to an intersection..Which way now Genius?XYFNKWJordan asked..Dillon moved the torch to the left passage then to right passage.XYFNKWHe was about to move the torch back to the left when something caught his eye on the.wall.XYFNKWThere appeared to be an arrow chalked onto the wall pointing down that passage.XYFNKWHe looked back to his brother who was now standing beside him, equally curious about the marking..Who do you suppose made that?XYFNKWJordan asked..I don’t know, Dillon replied.XYFNKWBut I know one thing for sure, it wasn’t John..Why do you say that?Well let’s think about it for a moment, Dillon responded.XYFNKWJohn had packed.this bag that we have so he could come and investigate this place, but he left it in his room.XYFNKWHe even sent the watch and arrowhead away from here to someone at.The Orion Group probably in the hopes that if something happened to him they.would be able to use it to find him, which we have.XYFNKWDillon shook his head.XYFNKWNo..I don’t think John ever made it down here.XYFNKWI think he knew that someone was onto him, but didn’t have time to get out before they grabbed him..Then why do you think he’s down here?XYFNKWJordan asked, trying to follow Dillon’s logic..That’s the thing.XYFNKWI’m not sure if he is or isn’t, Dillon said.XYFNKWDerek seems to think that whoever took John still has him alive.XYFNKWI’m not sure what he bases that on as he didn’t provide any information that would lead me to believe that..So we’re just following the blind hunches of a stranger?XYFNKWJordan’s anger was now evident..Shhhh!XYFNKWRemember what I told you about possible creatures being down.here?XYFNKWDillon reprimanded.XYFNKWAnyway, we’ll never know for sure unless we continue on..Whoa!XYFNKWLittle bro.XYFNKWThe only thing I want to do is find the way out before we.get killed or eaten or both.XYFNKWOr be killed by being eaten!XYFNKWJordan said as he waved the point of the knife he was carrying in Dillon’s direction..Yes, but the only way we know for sure how to get out of here is back the.way we came where that, whatever-it-was, was trying to kill us!XYFNKWGoing forward.is our only option Jordan..Jordan thought for a moment, contemplating their situation.XYFNKWFine, he said.at length.XYFNKWLead on..Dillon nodded and continued down the passageway.XYFNKWThey went another.twenty feet or so and came to another intersection and saw another one of those.arrow markings leading down the left one this time.XYFNKWDillon moved down that passage without saying a word as Jordan followed.XYFNKWThen they saw another intersection with an arrow marking leading down the right passage this time..This has to be marked out for whoever it is that works down here so they don’t.get lost, Dillon said as he worked out the logic in his head..You’re probably right, Jordan replied.XYFNKWI can’t think of any other reason why these are here.XYFNKWCan you?Dillon looked at him and shook his head..Great!XYFNKWSo if we follow these we run into bad guys!Jordan’s exclamation sent a chill down Dillon’s back.XYFNKWIf he was right, then.they were heading somewhere that didn’t have good prospects for their continued health.XYFNKWOn the other hand, they would probably find John..Not too much further down the passage, as the light illuminated to the extent.of its reach they noticed that there was a split in the tunnel which branched into two again.XYFNKWThey also noticed that something, or someone, was lying on the ground right at the intersection.XYFNKWThey slowed their pace not knowing what to expect.XYFNKWAs they got closer Dillon recognized the clothes that the person was wearing..Gwen!XYFNKWhe yelled as he broke into a run, closing the gap quickly between him and his sister.XYFNKWHe reached her and knelt beside her, touching her shoulder and trying to rouse her.XYFNKWShe groaned as he did so.XYFNKWJordan also ran up and knelt.beside their sister..After a few seconds Gwen’s eyes fluttered open.XYFNKWShe smiled weakly as she noticed Dillon and Jordan.XYFNKWWha— she tried to speak but the words wouldn’t come.XYFNKWShe appeared so groggy..Don’t try to speak yet Gwen, advised Jordan as he rubbed his hand on her.head.XYFNKWHe looked at Dillon, concern in his eyes..Why would she be here?XYFNKWJordan whispered to his brother..All Dillon could do was shrug.XYFNKWHe saw her in his dream but didn’t think she.would actually be down here.XYFNKWAs he and Jordan were moving through the tunnel.he actually began to believe that maybe his dream was wrong maybe it was only.giving him generalities of what was happening, or could potentially happen.XYFNKWIn.truth, the dreams already differed a little from what he actually experienced to this point most notably was the missing details of his and Jordan’s conversation..That dream wasn’t that specific it was more like faded snippets of the general event..This much was true now though, the important details of their current events.had come to pass.XYFNKWSuddenly Dillon cocked his head up..What?XYFNKWJordan asked in surprise..We need to go, Dillon responded sharply.XYFNKWWe need to go now!Jordan’s face went suddenly serious.XYFNKWOkay, he said as he reached his arms.around Gwen and hoisted her up.XYFNKWCome on Gwen.XYFNKWIt’s time to go..She nodded weakly, but was able to stand with the boy’s help..Which way?XYFNKWJordan asked..Dillon shone his light between the two passages and noted that there was an.arrow etching on the passage to the right pointing that way.XYFNKWThis way..Wait a minute Dillon, Jordan cut in, grabbing his arm.XYFNKWDidn’t you say that.these were probably made by someone—probably the bad guys—who worked.down here?XYFNKWProbably someone who would most likely kill us if they got the chance?XYFNKWI don’t know about you, but what I’ve experienced so far in dealing with these people, whoever they are, is that I really don’t want to meet them.XYFNKWWe are probably walking into their secret lair or something.XYFNKWAnd no one likes it when you just waltz into their secret lair!XYFNKWSo if we can go another way that maybe leads out without meeting up with them, then I think that’s a better option..Dillon couldn’t refuse his logic.XYFNKWIt was clear that, if John was alive, he would be down here with these guys.XYFNKWIt was also clear that these people weren’t friendly.XYFNKWDillon was starting to agree with his brother about not wanting to meet any of them anytime soon, even if he had to abandon his quest to find John..Seeing Gwen down here made him desire nothing more than to get out—and fast!Alright, he said as he started walking down the passage to the left.XYFNKWBefore.going too far he stopped and looked at Jordan.XYFNKWGive me your knife for a second..What for?Let’s make our own marks, just in case..Jordan got what he was saying and scraped an X in the side of the tunnel.XYFNKWIt.wasn’t as noticeable as the arrows were, but it would at least be noticed by them if they had to come back this way..After Jordan was finished, and they began moving again, he couldn’t shake.the images of the spider-like creatures he saw in his dream, or the jump they were forced to take off the cliff.XYFNKWHe couldn’t help but think—and hope—that these events could be altered somehow, but he wasn’t sure.XYFNKWIn fact, he wasn’t confident of anything anymore.XYFNKWThe dreams had come true to a point.XYFNKWThe only.difference was that Jordan and Gwen were in the dreams but never together.XYFNKWThis.puzzled Dillon more than a little, but it also gave him hope that maybe he could somehow change the outcome of what was about to happen..As his mind whirred with these confusing thoughts something on the wall caught his attention.XYFNKWIt was the symbol!Oh no, he blurted..What?XYFNKWJordan asked in a panicked tone..Watch out behind you!XYFNKWDillon yelled as he pushed Jordan and Gwen aside.just in time to see a giant spider-like creature with two large glowing yellow eyes emerge from the darkness..Jordan and Gwen stumbled into the wall as Dillon swung his torch at the leaping creature.XYFNKWThe flaming stick hit the beast right on one of its bulbous eyes and sent it flying to the floor.XYFNKWThe thing screeched and stumbled around, trying to get up.XYFNKWDillon hit it again and again until thick black goo came spraying out of it..It twitched a little and then stopped moving.XYFNKWSurprisingly the torch still held a bit of a flame, albeit less than before..Gwen broke into tears as Jordan grabbed her and pulled her away from the.thick hairy mush that was on the tunnel floor..What was … Jordan began to say but Dillon put up a hand to silence him..Do you hear that?XYFNKWhe asked sharply..Jordan cupped Gwen’s mouth with his hand as he listened.XYFNKWI hear— he began to say when they suddenly saw it: dozens of yellow eyes coming at them.from out of the gloom through the passage they just came down.XYFNKWJordan shined.his light in that direction and, as the creatures came into its glow, they screeched and slowed, but continued to advance..They don’t like the light!XYFNKWJordan yelled as he and his siblings started backing away..Quick then!XYFNKWWe need to move further down the tunnel.XYFNKWKeep shining the light back there as we run, Dillon instructed Jordan..As they moved, one of the creatures broke free from the pack, climbed the wall and scurried across the roof.XYFNKWDillon glanced back just in time to see it coming down at Jordan.XYFNKWReflexively, his brother shot out his hand that had the knife and stabbed the creature right in one of its bulging eyes.XYFNKWHe was forced to.run backwards as he tried to keep the light shining down the passage.XYFNKWThe thing screeched and snapped at Jordan with its pincers.XYFNKWJordan hit it with the flashlight a couple of times then quickly flicked his wrist and sent the beast sprawling to the floor..Dillon turned his head again and ran even faster with Gwen in tow..Every time he turned and glanced back to see how Jordan was making out,.he noticed that more of the creatures were trying to break free of the immediate glow of the flashlight..Dillon noticed that Jordan was trying hard to keep himself from stumbling as.the torch wasn’t putting out as much light as it was earlier, the flashlight was beginning to dim, and the tunnel in front of them was getting darker.XYFNKWThankfully the light glow from the fungi on the ceiling helped to illuminate some of the dark spots.XYFNKWThe kids moved as fast as they could but the creatures were still gaining on them..As Dillon ran he started to hear what sounded like a waterfall.XYFNKWGreat!XYFNKWhe said out loud as he knew what was coming.XYFNKWSure enough, the passage led out onto a ledge with open air and darkness before them.XYFNKWHe knew this was here because of his dreams, but the dreams never showed him whether or not they survive the fall.XYFNKWAt that moment the troubling thought hit him that maybe that’s why he never had any dreams about experiences that stretched beyond this point?He stopped a few feet before the ledge and put his arm out in order to grab.Gwen.XYFNKWShe stopped abruptly, being startled when Dillon grabbed her.XYFNKWJordan came through last.XYFNKWHe quickly came up to them and turned fully around to face.the tunnel they had just come through.XYFNKWHe was out of breath—they all were..Dillon turned to see that the creatures had started to make their way onto the.ledge.XYFNKWThey slowed and started to fan out as if to corner their prey..What’s the call little bro?XYFNKWJordan asked between gasps..Dillon shook his head in disbelief.XYFNKWThere’s only one thing we can do, he replied as he grabbed Gwen, looked at Jordan for a moment, and then leaped from the ledge and into the darkness.XYFNKWGwen let out a shriek of surprise as her and Dillon fell from view...JORDAN WATCHED IN HORROR AS HIS BROTHER AND SISTER PLUNGED INTO THE.gloom.XYFNKWHe looked back at the creatures who snapped at him with their pincers as.they stalked in.XYFNKWHis heart pounded in his chest, and his breathing came in quick gasps as his lungs tried to pull in the much needed air..He waved the flashlight around menacingly trying to keep the creatures at bay.XYFNKWOne of them broke free from the pack and leaped at him.XYFNKWReflexively he swung the flashlight and batted the thing as hard as he could on its bulbous body which sent it flying over the edge of the cliff.XYFNKWIts squeal was horrifying as it plunged into the darkness..Before anymore could attempt to strike a killing blow at their prey Jordan turned and leaped from the ledge....23.T H E L A B.Dillon could feel the rush of the cool air as he and Gwen plummeted.into the dark.XYFNKWDespite having to hang onto his little sister he somehow.managed to keep hold of the torch with his other hand.XYFNKWThe flame.whipped wildly in the air but refused to extinguish..Gwen continued to scream as they fell.XYFNKWDillon’s heart pounded, and his stomach felt as though it was stuck in his throat.XYFNKWHe tried to look down to see if the light illuminated enough of their fall in order to get a glimpse of what was coming, but tears streamed from his eyes which made it impossible to tell.XYFNKWThen.he felt it: the cold rush of water encompass his body.XYFNKWThe torch went out.XYFNKWDillon instinctively let go of his sister and torch as he tried frantically to surface.XYFNKWAs his head popped out of the water his lungs forced him to take in a deep breath.XYFNKWA moment later Gwen came up, gasping for air.XYFNKWDillon quickly swam over and grabbed her just under the arms.XYFNKWGwen kick and thrashed about wildly.XYFNKWDillon did everything he could to hold on without both of them going under..Gwen!XYFNKWhe yelled, trying to get her attention.XYFNKWGwen, it’s okay.XYFNKWI’ve got you, he said, this time in a calmer voice.XYFNKWIt’s okay.XYFNKWIt’s okay..After a moment he managed to calm her down as he swam them both to the.side.XYFNKWHe wasn’t sure if Jordan was coming.XYFNKWHe hoped that Jordan was coming..But he didn’t want to be in the way of him landing in the water..As he swam he looked around and noticed that the room they were in seemed.to be lit up by that same glowing substance they had seen earlier.XYFNKWAbout a dozen.feet or so from where they were was a ledge that opened up onto solid ground.XYFNKWIt looked like an open room as Dillon could make out in the dim glow a door at the.far end.XYFNKWHis mind had trouble processing it as it seemed out of place from the rest of the tunnels they had been through, and this underground cavern and waterway..As he swam harder in an effort to get him and Gwen to the shore he noticed a.light from above swirling around in all directions and coming in fast.XYFNKWJordan’s screams could be heard echoing around as he descended rapidly.XYFNKWDillon kicked.even harder, trying to put more distance between Jordan and themselves.XYFNKWJordan.hit the water—waves exploding all around from the impact.XYFNKWDillon and Gwen got hit by the wave.XYFNKWIt drenched them all over again, but the impact helped to propel them closer to the shore..We’re over here!XYFNKWDillon hollered as soon as he noticed Jordan surface.XYFNKWHis.legs felt as though they were about to give out, but as he reached back with his hand he felt the edge of the shoreline..With as much energy as he could muster he pulled Gwen closer to the solid.ground.XYFNKWHere Gwen.XYFNKWGrab onto this, he said through gritted teeth..Once they were out of the water they flopped over onto their backs and lay.there, trying to catch their breaths.XYFNKWA moment later Jordan joined them..Well … that was … fun, Jordan said between gasps of breath..Dillon got up, took his pack off, and slung it to the side before flopping back.down again..Another long moment went by before they heard Gwen say, I’m cold..Jordan quickly moved up close beside her and wrapped her in a big hug.XYFNKWIt’s.okay, he said reassuringly.XYFNKWIt’s actually not that cold down here.XYFNKWBy saying that he was telling the truth.XYFNKWIn fact, the temperature down there was quite warm..Trust me.XYFNKWYou’ll warm up right away..Dillon grabbed his pack again as he rose to his feet.XYFNKWI don’t suppose that flashlight still works?XYFNKWhe asked his brother..Surprisingly, Jordan still had it in his grasp but the light was out.XYFNKWHe shook it a few times and water came pouring out of it.XYFNKWNope, he replied..Dillon looked around.XYFNKWThey were in some sort of square room that appeared.to be manmade.XYFNKWThe walls and floors were made from the same natural stone that the rest of the place was, but there were light fixtures and other pipes running along the ceiling.XYFNKWThere were also old racks and a couple of broken tables and chairs scattered throughout..Obviously there used to be people down here doing who knows what,.Dillon stated as he walked to the other side of the room.XYFNKWHe found a light switch beside the door and flicked it on.XYFNKWSome of the fixtures flickered to life while others remained out and one even had a light bulb explode.XYFNKWThe kids jumped as.they were startled by the sudden explosion..Do you think it’s wise turning that on?XYFNKWJordan whispered loudly to Dillon..His brother merely shrugged.XYFNKWToo late now..The door had a large coating of dust and cobwebs on it which made it look as.though it hadn’t been opened in a long time.XYFNKWThe top portion had a large window.in it that was equally coated with thick dust.XYFNKWDillon swiped his hand across it making a large clear spot, disturbing the dust which floated into the air causing him to cough.XYFNKWThe window looked as though it was naturally fogged which would allow light to come in and exit, but would prevent anyone from seeing exactly what was happening on one side or the other.XYFNKWThrough the clear spot that Dillon had made the kids could see a little bit of light on the other side.XYFNKWThe light appeared to be far away or faded somehow..There’s gotta be someone down there, Jordan observed..I guess there’s only one way to find out, Dillon said as he reached for the.door handle.XYFNKWThe door seemed like it was welded in place.XYFNKWDillon tugged and reefed on the door with all his might but it wouldn’t budge.XYFNKWJordan moved him.aside and pushed on the door—even giving it a quick shot with his shoulder—.and it swung open.XYFNKWHe waved for Dillon to go first, giving him a knowing smirk..Dillon just shook his head as he walked through.XYFNKWGwen giggled at her brother’s.playful silent banter..The hallway on the other side appeared to be more constructed than the natural stone look of the room they just came through.XYFNKWIt was almost as though.they had entered a hospital—an old hospital—with the design of the tiled floor,.walls that appeared to be drywalled, and false ceiling that most likely concealed.water pipes and electrical wiring..It was a long hallway and the kids could see light shinning through from probably another room at the end.XYFNKWDillon and Jordan looked at each other for a.moment—both sharing silent concerns—before continuing.XYFNKWGwen took a hold of.a hand from each of her brothers.XYFNKWDillon saw a light switch on the wall and moved to flick it on, but before he got there Jordan grabbed his arm and shook.his head.XYFNKWDillon withdrew, understanding Jordan’s reasoning..The kids crept down the hall as quietly as they could their nerves were strung out as taut as they could go.XYFNKWThey looked around anxiously, hoping not to encounter any more creatures which might be lurking in the darkness..As they got closer to the end of the hallway they could hear the low hum of.electricity and a few other faint sounds that couldn’t quite be discerned.XYFNKWThey stopped about ten feet short..Okay, you stay here Gwen, Jordan stated as he let go of her and moved her.gently against the wall..We just need to take a peek, Dillon reassured..Gwen was not happy about it, but complied anyway..Dillon and Jordan inched closer to the opening.XYFNKWAll they could see at this point was some shelving units with a bunch of what appeared to be glass jars with various colors of liquids in them.XYFNKWThe jars all seemed to have labels on them, but from this distance the two brothers couldn’t make out any of the writing..When they got right to the edge they stopped and listened intently, hoping to.make out whether or not someone was in the room.XYFNKWThey couldn’t tell with the.hum of electricity.XYFNKWDillon finally made the decision to peek his head around the corner and see what was going on in there..He slowly poked his head out and surveyed the whole scope of the room.XYFNKWIt.appeared to be some sort of lab.XYFNKWThere were beakers of fluidic substances in what appeared to be processing equipment.XYFNKWSome were being heated and others.mixed.XYFNKWThere were a number of computer terminals scattered throughout the room on desks and tables..Dillon didn’t see anyone right away so he crept inside, trying to keep a.watchful eye.XYFNKWJordan grabbed his arm.XYFNKWAre you sure this is smart?XYFNKWhe asked..How else are we gonna get outta here?XYFNKWhe replied..The logic must have hit Jordan right away as he released his arm and nodded..The first thing Dillon noticed was that this room seemed to be kept in better.shape than the rest of the places they had been so far.XYFNKWThere was a door to the side that was marked with the distinctive Restroom sign on it, and at the far end there was another door that was shut..As he started to go through the room—Jordan right behind him—he noticed,.as he moved around some of the shelves, that there were cages lined up on one.of the walls which contained various types of animals: snakes, cats, coyotes, rats, and even a goat.XYFNKWDillon went over to where they were and found that they all seemed to be sedated..This place is starting to give me the creeps, whispered Jordan..It’s just starting now to give you the creeps?XYFNKWDillon asked sarcastically..Jordan smirked and shrugged.XYFNKWWe should probably see where that other.door leads before someone finds us, he said as he started to walk towards it..Just a second, Dillon said as he went to one of the computer terminals.XYFNKWHe.picked up the mouse and noticed that the laser on the bottom of it was still lit up which told him that the machine was still on.XYFNKWHe put it down and pushed the space bar on the keyboard.XYFNKWThe screen came to life and didn’t even ask for a password!XYFNKWHe saw that some of the programs where still open—minimized on the toolbar.XYFNKWWhen he maximized one of them he wasn’t able to make much sense.of the scientific mumbo jumbo, but what he did take away from it was that, whoever ran this lab, were producing something called Genesis and something.called Necrotoxin..Necrotoxin, he said out loud as he read..What?XYFNKWYou mean this, Jordan said as he held up a syringe he had pulled from a small stand that was on one of the racks.XYFNKWThere were probably a dozen such syringes on that stand, all lined up..Dillon walked over to him and took the syringe.XYFNKWSure enough it was labeled.Necrotoxin..There was something written on the computer that says this stuff is a byproduct of Genesis, he stated as he inspected it further.XYFNKWThe liquid was dark, dark blue which made it appear almost black.XYFNKWIt reminded him of sludge or oil..What about Genesis?XYFNKWDid you find any of that?What’s that?XYFNKWOh … here it is, Jordan said as he pulled another syringe filled with a light blue liquid from a different shelf..Dillon took that one too.XYFNKWThese somehow counteract each other, but I’m not.sure how.XYFNKWhe said as he put them in an outside pocket of his backpack.XYFNKWWe’d.better take them just in case..Good idea..Jordan started to look around again and got startled by Gwen who was right.beside him.XYFNKWGwen, I told you to stay out of the room until Dillon and I said it was safe!XYFNKWhe scolded..I know.XYFNKWIt’s just that … I was scared all by myself, she whimpered..It’s okay, said Jordan as he patted her on the shoulder.XYFNKWIt looks like everything’s good right now..Dillon went back to the computer terminal..What are you doing?XYFNKWJordan asked..Dillon was silent for a moment as he clicked away.XYFNKWDarn!XYFNKWhe yelled as loudly as he dared..What?XYFNKWJordan asked as he moved over to him..Oh, I just thought that maybe I’d be able to send an e-mail to Mom and Dad.letting them know what’s going on, but this computer isn’t actually connected to an outside network.XYFNKWProbably due to the depth below ground that we’re at and all the interference from the rocks..It was a good thought anyway, Jordan replied as he patted his brother on.the shoulder..Dillon nodded and went to the door that was on the other side of the room..He tried to look through the fogged glass to see if he could see anything on the other side.XYFNKWIt was no use.XYFNKWThe glass was too clouded.XYFNKWJordan came over and took.a peek in the window of the door himself..What’s the plan?XYFNKWhe asked..Dillon shrugged.XYFNKWI guess we take our chances, he replied..You don’t have any more of those, ‘I know where I’m going’ sort of feelings do you?Dillon shook his head and grabbed the door handle.XYFNKWSuddenly the main lights.went low, emergency lights started flashing, and an alarm started to blare.XYFNKWThe boys covered their ears, trying to dampen the deafening wine of the alarm.XYFNKWThey.looked behind them and saw Gwen standing beside the wall staring at them with.glowing yellow eyes!XYFNKWShe had the same eyes as all those creatures they had seen.before.XYFNKWHer hand was still holding onto the triggered security alarm that was on the wall..What the … Dillon spouted.XYFNKWWhat are you doing Gwen?XYFNKWhe yelled..She just stared at them with those glowing eyes—emotionless..Dillon was about to run over to her when the door behind them burst open and men grabbed them and held them fast.XYFNKWJordan and Dillon were thrown to the.ground hard—the wind being blasted from their lungs.XYFNKWDillon saw someone walk.over beside Gwen and patted her on the head.XYFNKWHe couldn’t get a good look at them as he was struggling with the man who had put him on the ground.XYFNKWAll he.could hear was a woman say, Good girl Gwen..He and Jordan were then picked up as though they weighed nothing.XYFNKWThe men twisted their arms around their backs which elicited a grunt from each boy.as they were marched down the hallway..Gwen!XYFNKWGwen!XYFNKWWhat did you do to our sister!XYFNKWDillon shouted, trying to look.back to see if he could still see her.XYFNKWGwen!..24.T H E M O N S T E R.Dillon and Jordan struggled against their captors to no avail as they.were led down the long hallway.XYFNKWTheir arms were held tightly behind.them by what seemed to be an iron grip..Where’s my sister!XYFNKWDillon screamed, wondering what they had done to.Gwen that made her eyes glow yellow.XYFNKWThe image of the coyotes, rat, and snake.came rushing to his mind as he thought about his sister..Don’t worry, came a smooth woman’s voice from behind.XYFNKWShe’s right here.and doing just fine..Dillon knew he had heard that voice before.XYFNKWIt couldn’t be!XYFNKWImages flashed in.his mind from a few days back when he had rented the bike from the on-site shop at the resort.XYFNKWHe was sure it was the woman at the desk, Tara!XYFNKWHow many of these people are involved in this?XYFNKWhe wondered to himself.XYFNKWHis mind whirled with all the possibilities of the different people he met.XYFNKWCould Janeen be a part of it too?XYFNKWhe thought..He brought his focus back quickly as he knew he would have to find a way.out of this if he and his siblings had a chance of surviving.XYFNKWAnd he had to resign to the fact that he would have to take Tara’s word that Gwen was fine..The hallway turned and then opened up into another room.XYFNKWDillon and Jordan.were thrown forcefully to the floor.XYFNKWAs they began to rise they noticed some cages to the left of them against the wall.XYFNKWThe room was large with a high ceiling.XYFNKWIt resembled the last room with a dozen or so computer terminals,.chemistry-type equipment with beakers brewing an assortment of different colored liquids, Bunsen burners, and lots of microscopes and lab hand tools strewn about the many counters.XYFNKWA few people in lab coats appeared to be at work at the various stations.XYFNKWThey didn’t even turn to acknowledge the new arrivals.XYFNKWAll of them had the same glowing eyes that Gwen now had..Dillon looked to the cages and noticed immediately that Tom Tom was slunk.down in the corner of one of them.XYFNKWNext to his, in adjoining cells, were a few people he didn’t recognize—and next to them was … Derek!XYFNKWDillon’s heart skipped a beat when he saw Derek and Tom Tom still alive.XYFNKWDerek looked like he.had a fight with a bus and lost badly!XYFNKWDillon wasn’t even sure if he was still alive..But how?XYFNKWhe whispered to himself, unable to understand how Derek could.have been brought down here before them, unless there was either another entrance, or he was taken down the direct route that he, Jordan, and Gwen avoided after they found Gwen.XYFNKWEither way, he was just happy to see the man again.XYFNKWHe just hoped he was still alive..As he scanned the room some more he saw, standing next to one of the computer stations, a man that looked familiar.XYFNKWThe man turned to him, his eyes.were glowing yellow just like Gwen’s.XYFNKWDillon flinched in surprise.XYFNKWIt took a second but Dillon finally recognized him.XYFNKWIt was John!John stared at him for a moment with a blank, yellow-eyed, stare and then went back to work..Impressive isn’t it?XYFNKWhe heard a voice say that jolted him from his shock..He and Jordan both looked to the side and saw a man coming down some stairs from another hallway at that side of the room.XYFNKWDillon recognized him immediately.XYFNKWIt was Troy!XYFNKWTroy smiled at the two brothers as he entered the room..You know … I never thought you would make it this far, he said in a tone.that sounded almost impressed..So you’re the one behind all this, Dillon accused..Wait … Jordan said in a questioning tone.XYFNKWWhat is all this?XYFNKWhe asked looking to his brother.XYFNKWHe glanced over at Troy as a look of recognition played...across his face.XYFNKWIsn’t that the guy that we met at the front gate when we came.in?XYFNKWJordan asked..Troy laughed..No offence, Jordan said cutting Troy’s laugh short.XYFNKWBut you’re not exactly.intimidating.XYFNKWYou know … ‘ The Gate Keeper’ and all..Troy grinned wickedly and nodded toward him.XYFNKWSuddenly Jordan was lifted.off his feet.XYFNKWDillon couldn’t believe the ease at which the guy who grabbed his.brother hoisted him into the air..Cool isn’t it?XYFNKWTroy commented.XYFNKWIt’s called Centrigenix.XYFNKWIt’s a chemical compound that affects the nervous and muscular system of a person to such an.extent that they are able to perform extraordinary feats at least, that is, until the effects wear off which, as we just discovered is pretty quick.XYFNKWBut Rob there has enough juice to last for a little bit longer I think.XYFNKWLong enough to show you some manners..As soon as he finished speaking Rob threw Jordan into the air..JORDAN’S HEART POUNDED AS HE FELT HIMSELF TAKE OFF.XYFNKWNOOOOOO!XYFNKWHE.heard Dillon scream.XYFNKWHe closed his eyes as he slammed into the steel bars of one of the cages.XYFNKWHe felt the wind being blown from his lungs as he landed hard on.the floor.XYFNKWHe writhed around, trying to get up.XYFNKWHis vision blurred a little but then came back to normal a few seconds later.XYFNKWHis side and his arms hurt.XYFNKWHe didn’t.think anything was broken but couldn’t be sure.XYFNKWHe looked toward Dillon and Gwen and saw that Dillon was racing over to see if he was okay.XYFNKWRob and the other guy that brought Dillon down the hallway moved as if to go and retrieve.him, but Troy put up a hand to stop them..Dillon stooped down.XYFNKWAre you okay bro?XYFNKWhe asked urgently..Ya, I think so, replied Jordan with a wince as he felt a sharp pain in his side when he spoke..DILLON HELPED JORDAN TO HIS FEET, THEN TURNED BACK TO TROY.XYFNKWWHAT DID.you do to my sister and John?XYFNKWhe asked accusingly..Troy slowly walked over to where Gwen was standing with the woman from.the bike shop.XYFNKWOh she’s fine, he said.XYFNKWWe just implanted her and John with a.neurogenic transmitter..A neuro what?It’s for mind control, he heard Derek say in a weak voice from his cell..They implanted them with a chip that makes them completely obedient to their.commands.XYFNKWIt must be the same chip you found in the coyote..But why?XYFNKWDillon asked..Well … you see, John and his team are the scientists that created the original batch of Genesis..Dillon looked dumbfounded.XYFNKWBut John’s an archeologist, not a scientist..Troy laughed.XYFNKWNo Dillon, actually he’s not.XYFNKWYou’ve been fed a line.XYFNKWJohn was sent to Oasis Resort—undercover posing as an archeologist—in order to track down the location of the serum that we stole a few years ago.XYFNKWIt’s kind of funny.XYFNKWJohn did such a good job at playing the part, and with the help of Orion.and their vast resources, they were able to fabricate his whole life as an archeologist so that no one would suspect him..If you didn’t want anyone finding Genesis then why would you even let him.come here with a team to look for the supposed source of the springs?XYFNKWDillon.asked, rather dumbfounded with the whole situation..Troy laughed again.XYFNKWBecause, over the years we have allowed such.expeditions to occur and no one has ever been able to even come close to what.we’re doing here.XYFNKWWe have hidden our secrets quite well.XYFNKWThe problem with John, is that he was the creator of this particularly helpful chemical agent, and that gave him an advantage that the others didn’t have.XYFNKWHe knew its chemical makeup and was able to detect traces of it in certain spots around the resort which allowed him to accurately estimate the location of where we were dumping it into the underground water supply.XYFNKWHe’s quite brilliant really..So then how did you find out that John wasn’t who he said he was?Troy smirked and looked briefly to one of the cages..He followed Troy’s gaze.XYFNKWTom Tom?XYFNKWDillon blurted, as the truth dawned on him.XYFNKWHe saw the broken man in the cage slump a little more..It’s not like that, Tom Tom replied weakly.XYFNKWI didn’t … I never meant to ….XYFNKWTears streamed from the old man’s face.XYFNKWHe’s my friend..Dillon didn’t know what to think, and Troy seemed to be enjoying the drama.as he grinned wickedly..After we found out who John really was we figured that it was only a matter.of time before he discovered our secret and reported back to The Orion Group..He paused for a moment in self-reflection.XYFNKWYou know, at first we didn’t know that Orion was even involved in this, but we made preparations anyway in order.to deal with whoever it was once we took John into our care..By creating these monsters?XYFNKWDillon interjected..Yes, and we made a few other provisions, but the Necrotoxic creatures were.definitely top of our achievement.XYFNKWYou can thank John for those..Dillon swallowed hard and even flinched a little at the mention of the Necrotoxic creatures..John’s gifts of manipulating chemical properties is most useful..I assume you tortured him into telling you who sent him?XYFNKWDerek accused..No no no, nothing that crude, Troy replied calmly.XYFNKWWe have other ways of.finding out the information we need.XYFNKWThe neurogenic transmitters don’t just allow us to control the mind, but sift it as well.XYFNKWJohn’s knowledge of the science is extremely impressive..Do you know why it’s called necrotoxin?XYFNKWhe continued.XYFNKWBecause it.actually kills the creature and brings it back in a, shall we say, more formidable state.XYFNKWIt makes changes to their genetic code and gives them features that aren’t natural to them, as you probably noticed with the large snake creature that had arms, or the coyotes that are larger than normal and possess acidic saliva.XYFNKWBefore we do that, however, we make sure to implant the neurogenic transmitter first so they are perfectly under control..But why did you put one of those neurogenic transmitters in Gwen?XYFNKWDillon.asked, almost shouting as his anger started to surface..Troy gave Dillon a dismissive wave as he walked over to where Gwen was..It’s really quite simple, he stated matter-of-factly.XYFNKWIt’s because you were starting to become an annoyance, and Orion kept a pretty close eye on you.XYFNKWWe.figured that if you somehow managed to find your way down here then we would have to put a contingency plan in place to deal with it.XYFNKWWhen we were notified that you were on your way through the information center, we snatched.up your sister—after dealing with the two Orion agents that were watching your.family—and put her in the tunnel and programmed her to alert us of your presence if you made it to the lab facility.XYFNKWIt worked pretty well wouldn’t you say?XYFNKWhe stated as he patted Gwen on the head..Get your hands off her you jerk!XYFNKWJordan yelled through gritted teeth..Wouldn’t surveillance cameras be easier than using human pawns?XYFNKWDillon.asked in disgust..Ah, but that’s the problem with working down here Dillon.XYFNKWYou must have.figured that out by now?XYFNKWElectronics don’t function the same close to these magnetic rocks now do they?Then how are you able to keep the computers in the lab running?Troy laughed again.XYFNKWMan!XYFNKWYou are observant and nothing gets passed you,.does it?XYFNKWThe computers are hooked up to massive generators so we can use them,.and even then we can only operate for so long until we have to shut them down..You might have noticed some blackout periods at the resort?Dillon thought back and remembered a few of the moments Troy was talking.about..Those were times when our power here at Oasis Resort was taxed to the max and couldn’t be sustained because of all of this.XYFNKWHe held his arms open dramatically as if totally caught up in his own genius..That’s great and all, Jordan interjected.XYFNKWBut why are you telling us all this?Troy turned his attention to Dillon.XYFNKWSo you can see what’s already being accomplished!XYFNKWWe’re doing great things, Dillon.XYFNKWThings you could be a part of..John’s scientific genius is great, but we need someone who can spot problems and connections.XYFNKWSomeone like you..Well that’s not going to happen!XYFNKWDillon responded resolutely..I was afraid you would say that, Troy replied as he nodded to Rob, the man who had thrown Jordan into the air a moment earlier.XYFNKWI guess we will just have.to dispose of you and your family.XYFNKWYou know too much.XYFNKWRob smiled and started.to approach the two brothers..What are you doing?XYFNKWDerek asked insistently from his cell.XYFNKWThey’re just boys!You should have thought of that before you got them into this, Troy snapped back..Wait Troy, that wasn’t part of the deal!XYFNKWTara exclaimed.XYFNKWYou said you just.wanted to capture the kids..Sorry Tara, but things just got more complicated, replied Troy.XYFNKWWe now have to clean up this mess, he stated.XYFNKWTry to make it quick Rob.XYFNKWI can’t stand to see people suffer.XYFNKWWe’ll take care of Derek and the others after..With pleasure, Rob responded..Dillon’s heart pounded in his chest.XYFNKWHe knew now that his life was about to.be cut short.XYFNKWAnd the worst thing was that he got his sister and brother mixed up in this as well, and now they were about to pay the ultimate price because of him..How are you going to explain the disappearances of three kids?XYFNKWDerek insisted, trying to talk reason into the madman.XYFNKWDon’t do this!XYFNKWhe yelled..Oh … we’ll think of something, said Troy as he dismissed Derek’s plea..We always do..Rob strolled over and stood before the boys.XYFNKWHe reached down, going for Dillon’s neck, but before he could get close enough Jordan shot his hand up and.grabbed the man’s wrist.XYFNKWRob smiled.XYFNKWThen his smile turned into a look of confusion as he found that he couldn’t move his hand toward Dillon anymore..He looked at Jordan who stared back, a mischievous grin on his face.XYFNKWJordan held up his other hand revealing a small syringe with the label on it that read: Centrigenix.XYFNKWBefore Rob could react Jordan grabbed him by the shirt and threw.him across the room.XYFNKWRob slammed into the other guy who, a moment earlier, helped bring Dillon and Jordan into the room from the lab.XYFNKWThe man slammed the back of his head into the wall and the crack from the blow reverberated.through the room.XYFNKWBoth he and Rob slumped to the ground in a heap..Tara grabbed Gwen and pulled her aside as Rob flew through the air like a.rag doll.XYFNKWThey both stumbled and fell to the ground.XYFNKWTroy dived out of the way of the human projectile..Whoa!XYFNKWwas all that Dillon could say as he looked at his brother’s handy-work..Jordan smiled at him.XYFNKWThis stuff works pretty good!XYFNKWQuick, go grab Gwen,.he yelled as he headed to the cages.XYFNKWDillon nodded and ran as fast as he could toward the fray of bodies, hoping he would get there before they got back to their senses..Stop them!XYFNKWTroy yelled as he stumbled toward one of the nearby desks..Dillon leaped over top of Rob and the other guy and grabbed Gwen by the.hand.XYFNKWHer eyes were still glowing yellow.XYFNKWTara still held onto Gwen’s other arm.as she tried to get up.XYFNKWDillon quickly slipped his pack off and swung it as hard as he could.XYFNKWHe heard a loud crack as the bag landed squarely on the woman’s face..She jolted backward and hit the floor, writhing in pain and holding her nose..Jordan got to Derek’s cage, grabbed the lock, and pulled it off as though it was made of cheap plastic instead of steel.XYFNKWDerek looked at him in amazement,.but before he could say anything Jordan was off to the next cage tearing the lock free..Troy reached for something in one of the desks.XYFNKWIt was a small tablet.XYFNKWHe started sliding his finger across the screen and hitting buttons as he went.XYFNKWJordan finished breaking the last lock off the cages and turned to see where Dillon was..As he did so, he heard the ugly howl of coyotes, and a loud hissing sound.XYFNKWHe.smiled as he saw creatures coming into the room from the hallway to the left..There were three coyote-type creatures, that large snake-thing they had encountered in the information center, and a few of those spider beasts..Let’s do this!XYFNKWJordan screamed..Dillon pulled Gwen up and tried to get her away from the sprawled-out people they were in the midst of.XYFNKWRob was beginning to stir, but the other guy looked as though he was out cold.XYFNKWDillon managed to get Gwen over to where the others were.XYFNKWThankfully she didn’t resist or appear as if she was going to put.up a fight she just stared blankly with those yellow eyes..The people working at the stations were equally disinterested in the events that were transpiring around them.XYFNKWThey just sat at their terminals and continued to work.XYFNKWIt was both comical and eerie all at the same time!Make sure nothing happens to Gwen, Dillon shouted to his brother as he grabbed something out of the side of his backpack and started off, running for Troy as fast as he could..What are you doing you numbskull!XYFNKWJordan cried after him..Dillon ducked as one of the coyotes lunged for him, narrowly missing him as.he ran for Troy.XYFNKWTroy looked up just in time to see Dillon charging.XYFNKWHe tried to move out of the way but couldn’t get clear.XYFNKWDillon leaped upon him and plunged.the Necrotoxin into Troys side.XYFNKWTroy screamed in pain and managed to backhand.Dillon across the face.XYFNKWThe boy tumbled off.XYFNKWHe almost swooned, but managed to.shake away the dizziness.XYFNKWHe lunged toward Troy with his other hand, another syringe leading the way.XYFNKWTroy howled and thrashed.XYFNKWHe hit Dillon’s arm and the.syringe went flying from his grasp.XYFNKWIt hit the ground and rolled away.XYFNKWTroy grabbed his head and screamed more as he hunched over.XYFNKWDillon was surprised.that the syringe didn’t shattered on impact when it hit the floor.XYFNKWHe counted himself lucky and tried to dive toward it but Troy suddenly swung out with one.of his arms and hit the boy on the side.XYFNKWDillon felt the wind being blasted from his lungs with the force of the blow which sent him flying into the wall..What have you done?XYFNKWscreamed Derek as they all watched in horror as Troy began to transform..Dillon shook off the dizziness again and stumbled back toward the cages where Gwen and Jordan were with Derek and Tom Tom..I was trying to get him with the Necrotoxin and Genesis!XYFNKWDillon tried to explain.XYFNKWBut he knocked Genesis out of my hand before I could inject him..Good idea—bad execution!XYFNKWDerek screamed..Ya … sorry about that..They heard bone crunching and skin tearing.XYFNKWHis howls turned into a deep, guttural, demonic scream.XYFNKWHe fell over a nearby chair and curled up on the ground, writhing in absolute pain.XYFNKWFour large spikes shot out of his back spraying.blood and yellowish spinal fluid everywhere his muscles bulged as they tore through his shirt, and his skin turned a dark bluish hue.XYFNKWAs Troy’s transformation ensued, even the creatures who had charged into the room a moment earlier stopped their approach toward their intended victims..Troy’s screams died down and his writhing slowed until he finally stopped moving..Is he dead?XYFNKWDillon heard Gwen say in a soft quivering voice..He looked at her in dismay.XYFNKWHer eyes no longer shone in that eery yellow glow.XYFNKWA moment earlier she was a captive zombie but now she appeared normal..He looked over to where John and the others were and noticed that they were shaking their heads and regaining their senses..The creatures that had entered the room were all looking around as though they were unsure of who they should attack.XYFNKWTheir eyes didn’t glow anymore either.XYFNKWA coyote approached the monstrous mass that used to be Troy and began.to sniff and growl at it.XYFNKWWith lightning speed a large clawed hand grabbed the creature by the neck.XYFNKWA loud snap was heard and the coyote went limp..Still holding the unfortunate creature in his grasp, the monster that had been.Troy a moment earlier began to slowly stand his back facing Dillon and the others.XYFNKWIt grasped the edge of one of the tables for support as it stood to its full height.XYFNKWThat was when Dillon noticed the shattered tablet that Troy used to call the creatures—and probably control John and the others—at his feet..Rob, still shaking off the dizziness, was able to finally stand.XYFNKWHe looked over.to the towering monster.XYFNKWHis eyes went wide as he saw the hulking beast just a.few feet from where he was.XYFNKWHe turned to run when Troy swung his free arm around.XYFNKWThe massive clawed hand hammered into the back of Rob, sending him.flying into the wall.XYFNKWHis limp body skipped off the wall and bounced to the floor..He rolled a couple times and came to rest at Dillon’s feet.XYFNKWThe young boy looked down at the body in horror, then glanced up to where Troy was..The huge beast turned around slowly.XYFNKWHis head was misshapen to resemble more of a dog than a human.XYFNKWHis eyes were large and bloodshot, and he now had.huge canine fangs protruding from his massive maw.XYFNKWHe looked down at his transformed body as if trying to process what had happened to him, then he.threw the dead coyote to the side.XYFNKWThe creature flew into one of the spider things which issued a high-pitched shrill.XYFNKWTroy narrowed his eyes at Dillon and began.to growl..What now?XYFNKWJordan asked, desperation in his voice..We need that syringe, Dillon replied, looking over to where it had bounced.and rolled across the ground.XYFNKWIt’s our only option now..Troy hunched low and opened both his hands fully, showing his wicked.looking claws.XYFNKWHe stared at the boys with evil intent and roared, spittle spraying from his mouth....25.T H E F I G H T F O R T H E I R L I V E S!Jordan grabbed Gwen and dove to the side as the monster charged.XYFNKWDerek,.Dillon and Tom Tom scattered, scrambling to get out of the way just in time as the beast slammed into the cages, crumpling the bars as though they were nothing..Jordan easily sprinted to the other side of the room with Gwen under one arm.XYFNKWHe felt so charged up from the Centrigenix as he leaped into the air and easily cleared some chairs, a lab table, and one of the guys who was still coming out from the mind control of the neurogenic transmitter.XYFNKWHe landed softly on the other side and ducked down behind the table with his little sister.XYFNKWAs they came over the counter one of the coyotes lunged in their direction.XYFNKWJordan threw his arm out wide in order to protect him and his sister.XYFNKWHis backhand connected with the creature with such force that it was sent flying all the way across the room.XYFNKWIt hit the wall with a crack and crumpled to the ground.XYFNKWHe looked at his hand for a moment, not sure what to make of his new-found power.XYFNKWApparently his reflexes.were just as dialled up as his muscles were..You wait here okay Gwen, Jordan said softly as he turned and looked at her, trying to be as soothing as possible.XYFNKWTry and hide from … well ….everything.XYFNKWHe stood up and turned to head back.XYFNKWGwen grabbed his arm..Be careful please, she said, tears welling up in her eyes..Jordan smiled back at her and nodded.XYFNKWHis face turned grim as he surveyed.the chaos.XYFNKWA couple of the spider creatures were attacking one of the scientists...who, a moment earlier, was under the influence of the neurogenic transmitter..John, himself, was fighting off the other coyote with what appeared to be a chair leg and a scalpel, and Tom Tom was keeping the serpent-thing busy.XYFNKWThen he saw it—the main event was about to begin once Troy dislodged himself from the.bars—Troy verses Derek!XYFNKWDerek was equipping himself for the fight as he walked toward the creature..Man!XYFNKWThat guys got guts!XYFNKWJordan thought to himself..DILLON SCRAMBLED OVER ROB’S LIMP BODY AS HE DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM.the creature in his search for the syringe.XYFNKWTroy grunted as he pulled himself out from the mangled mess of bars and whipped his head around to see Dillon across.the room.XYFNKWHis eyes narrowed and his lips curled up in a monstrous snarl as he started toward him.XYFNKWSuddenly a loud crack rang through the air.XYFNKWHis head jolted.to the side with the force of the blow.XYFNKWHe shook it off and turned to see Derek standing there with a chunk of bar he had grabbed from the cages..Derek went in for another strike but Troy easily deflected it with his huge muscled forearm.XYFNKWThe force of the hit would have broken a regular persons arm.in two, but the beast acted as though he didn’t even feel it.XYFNKWDerek swung again, but Troy grabbed the bar and ripped it from his grasp..The monster stood to his full ten foot height, howled like a demon—spit spraying from his mouth—and came down toward Derek.XYFNKWThe battle-hardened man tried to maneuver around and grab another weapon, but held his ribs and winced in pain which caused him to stumble and slump to this knees.XYFNKWHe got into.the best defensive position he could in order to receive the charge from the creature, but knew it would be futile, and that his life was about to end..The monster stormed in he could almost smell its foul breath..JORDAN SAW DEREK ATTACK THE CREATURE AND KNEW HE NEEDED HELP.XYFNKWHE..easily leaped over the counter and sprinted toward Troy.XYFNKWHe could see the monster coming in at Derek with the force of a rhino.XYFNKWWith all the power he could generate with his enhanced body he slammed into the behemoth with his.shoulder.XYFNKWHe issued a loud scream as he rocked into the beast..Troy was launched into the air with the strength of a giant and crashed into.the wall of cages again.XYFNKWDerek couldn’t believe what he saw!Get out of here!XYFNKWJordan yelled, rubbing his shoulder with his hand.XYFNKWHis charge was effective but he didn’t come away from it totally unscathed.XYFNKWIn truth, however, Jordan felt that he got less hurt than he would have ever expected to..He walked over to what was left of the cages and easily pulled a chunk of bar from the concrete floor..Not gonna happen kid, Derek replied as he pulled himself up and limped.over and retrieved the bar he had just a moment earlier.XYFNKWWe’re gonna do this together..Jordan smiled.XYFNKWIt was a weird feeling as he never really considered himself incredibly brave before.XYFNKWBut now he just had a feeling of absolute superiority.XYFNKWIt had to be the Centrigenix..I don’t know what you’re on, said Derek, but I wish I had some..Jordan smiled at the comment..Troy shook his head again as he got up from the mess once more and howled.XYFNKWHe now appeared angrier than ever!DILLON LOOKED OVER TO WHERE TROY WAS AND SAW DEREK HIT HIM ON THE.side of the head with such force that he could hear the crack reverberate throughout the room.XYFNKWHe knew that he had to find Genesis fast.XYFNKWHe scrambled around the floor on his hands and knees in search of the syringe.XYFNKWHe knew it had to be over here somewhere.XYFNKWThen he saw it!XYFNKWIt had rolled under one of the lab tables when it was knocked from his hand.XYFNKWHe started to crawl toward it when suddenly he felt something grab his leg.XYFNKWHe turned to see Tara trying to pull him in.XYFNKWHer nose was clearly broken from the impact of Dillon’s backpack earlier—...blood dripped easily from it as she reached for the boy with her other hand..Dillon shot his free leg out and smashed her in the face again.XYFNKWOh how she screamed as his foot shattered her nose more thoroughly!She let go of his leg as she cried out in agony, cupping her face in her hands..When Dillon turned his head back toward his goal he saw one of the spiders standing in front of it, staring at him with its large bulbous eyes.XYFNKWIt’s pincers snapped threateningly..TOM TOM BARELY MANAGED TO DODGE THE SNAPPING MAW OF THE SNAKE.creature.XYFNKWHe didn’t know if he could keep this up for much longer.XYFNKWHe heard the.chaotic battles that were going on throughout the entire room, but tried to remain focussed upon the current threat in front of him..The creature swung a scaly clawed hand around and clipped the man on the.shoulder.XYFNKWTom Tom screamed in pain as he grabbed for his shoulder and fell back, tripping over a chair and landing hard on the floor.XYFNKWFour lines of blood splayed through his shirt where the thing had hit him.XYFNKWIt hissed and reared up, much like a cobra would do just before it came in to strike the final blow on its victim.XYFNKWAs it came in for the kill Tom Tom quickly grabbed the chair and shot it upwards in its path.XYFNKWThe thing hit it hard, snapping and hissing, trying to get to its prey.XYFNKWTom Tom felt himself sliding across the floor from the force that the creature was exerting on the chair.XYFNKWFor some reason it wasn’t reaching around with its muscled arms, but was rather trying to slither through the desperate man’s defences with its head.XYFNKWThe old man only hoped that the creature would continue to, apparently, forget about its other appendages.XYFNKWIf it did he thought that he might have a chance..He held on stubbornly with each lunge of the snake, not willing to allow the.creature to take his life from him...JORDAN SIDESTEPPED THE INCOMING ATTACK.XYFNKWHE FELT THE CLAWED HAND PASS BY.him just inches from his face..Derek swung his bar from the other side and connected solidly on Troy’s arm.XYFNKWThe creature howled and came up at him with his other hand.XYFNKWAs he swung.around Jordan connected with his bar solidly on the beast’s side.XYFNKWThe shock of the blow rocked the huge creature from his solid footing and put him off balance..Derek came in again, but Troy managed to react quicker than the man had expected and blocked the blow.XYFNKWThe creature returned the strike and Derek tried.to get out of the way but got clipped on the shoulder by his massive hand..Despite the lessened force in the attack due to Jordan’s hit, Derek went flying back and spun around a couple of times before landing on a table and toppling.onto the ground..Troy held his side where Jordan landed the hit and backed away a step from.the kid.XYFNKWHe eyed him cautiously.XYFNKWYou fast and strong, Troy grunted, shifting to the side..Jordan frowned as he looked at Troy.XYFNKWYou ape man or something?XYFNKWThat’s not.how people talk..Troy smiled, his yellowed eyes glinting with cunning.XYFNKWYou die, he said, and then he rushed in at Jordan..DILLON EYED THE CREATURE AS IT SLOWLY MOVED TOWARD HIM MENACINGLY.XYFNKWHE.backed up and started to stand.XYFNKWThe spider leaped!XYFNKWDillon ducked just in time as the creature flew overtop of him.XYFNKWHe spun around quickly to see that the spider.had already landed and was running toward him again.XYFNKWAs it sprang he deftly unslung his backpack and swung it out in front.XYFNKWIt clipped the creature and sent it off to the side.XYFNKWHardly injured, it jumped at Dillon again.XYFNKWThis time he barely got his pack out in front.XYFNKWThe thing latched on, trying to climb overtop and onto the young boy.XYFNKWIt snapped its pincers wildly, tearing into the bag..Frantically, Dillon tried to shake it off, but the thing wouldn’t let go.XYFNKWIt snapped at one of Dillon’s hands.XYFNKWHe managed to pull mostly out of the way, but..got nipped across two of his fingers.XYFNKWHe screamed in pain as he pulled his hand.back and threw the bag to the floor as he backed away..The horrid creature climbed out from behind it and advanced.XYFNKWIt leaped and.Dillon dove under the nearby table.XYFNKWThe thing nimbly landed on top of the table..Dillon crouched down, looking to both sides wondering which way the creature.would attack from.XYFNKWHe looked at his hand and noticed that the cuts weren’t too.bad.XYFNKWHe just hoped the spider wasn’t venomous, but he’d have to worry about that later..As he looked around he noticed the syringe again, only a few feet from where he was hiding.XYFNKWQuickly, he shot his hand out from under the table and grabbed it, hoping that the spider thing didn’t see the movement.XYFNKWAs he looked.up, he saw Gwen pulling supplies out of a cupboard.XYFNKWShe snatched up a scalpel.in shaking hands and crawled into the hiding place.XYFNKWHe had one last glimpse of.her tear streaked face before she pulled the door closed..Dillon’s gut twisted with guilt.XYFNKWHe had gotten Gwen into this.XYFNKWShe hadn’t asked to face a gruesome death.XYFNKWHis curiosity did that to her.XYFNKWHe gripped the syringe tighter in his fist.XYFNKWHe wouldn’t let Gwen die.XYFNKWHe would die first..As fast as lightning he sprang out from under the table in a dead run toward.Troy..TOM TOM’S ARMS WERE GETTING WEAK WITH THE RELENTLESS ATTACKS OF THE.creature.XYFNKWHe knew his time was near.XYFNKWThe creature had finally realized that its arms were long enough to reach around the chair the old man was using to defend himself.XYFNKWIt swung an arm around and grabbed Tom Tom by the shoulder..It squeezed down hard, sinking its dirty claws into the man’s flesh.XYFNKWTom Tom screamed!With that one arm it hoisted him into the air.XYFNKWTom Tom’s screams echoed throughout the room.XYFNKWThe snake hissed wildly and pulled back his other arm, readying for the final blow that would take the man down..The old man’s eyes rolled back into his head from the pain, then he felt..himself falling.XYFNKWHe hit the ground hard and felt pain shooting through his body..Everything was spinning.XYFNKWHe didn’t know if he was dead or still alive.XYFNKWThen he.heard a familiar voice speaking to him..Tom Tom!XYFNKWTom Tom!XYFNKWcame the voice..His eyes fluttered open and there, staring at him from above, was John!You okay old friend?XYFNKWJohn asked frantically.XYFNKWSpeak to me!You need to shave, replied Tom Tom weakly as he tried to smile..John laughed.XYFNKWCome on then.XYFNKWWe need to get you out of here..What happened to the snake-thing?I gave it a cocktail of acidic chemicals to take it down a notch, John replied.XYFNKWIt’s not going to bother anyone again..Tom Tom looked over at the creature only a few feet away writhing on the.ground in absolute agony.XYFNKWIt appeared to be in its death throes.XYFNKWYou got anymore of that?XYFNKWhe asked..Unfortunately not, replied John as he placed one of Tom Tom’s arms.around his neck.XYFNKWI have no more compounds to use.XYFNKWThe others are on their own.with that.XYFNKWHe turned slightly to note the battle that was going on by the cages with Troy, Jordan, and Derek.XYFNKWThey saw Derek go down and Jordan knock the creature into the cages again..That kid’s got spirit, Tom Tom remarked..He has more than that, John replied cryptically.XYFNKWLet’s hope it’s enough,.he finished as he began moving Tom Tom to the other side of the room, careful.to avoid those who would never have a chance to leave again..DILLON RAN ACROSS THE ROOM AS FAST AS HIS FEET WOULD CARRY HIM.XYFNKWHE.glanced back and saw that the spider was in pursuit and gaining on him.XYFNKWHe looked down at the syringe while he ran and knew that he only had one shot at.this.XYFNKWAt that moment he realized he couldn’t be concerned with the spider-thing.right now.XYFNKWHe knew what he had to do...TROY CAME AT JORDAN WITH ALL HIS FURY!XYFNKWTHE TEENAGER MET THE CHARGE..He balled up his hand into a tight fist and punched Troy right in the stomach as he came in.XYFNKWHe could tell that the blow had hurt the creature, but Troy didn’t relent from his attack.XYFNKWHe swung his fist around and nailed Jordan right in the face.XYFNKWJordan’s head rocked to the side, but he shook off the blow..Jordan punched again, this time hitting him in the face.XYFNKWTroy’s head snapped.back from the blow.XYFNKWThe creature grabbed Jordan around the throat with his other hand and punched him in the stomach.XYFNKWThe kid felt that one!XYFNKWBut he shook off the pain and came in again with another punch, screaming as he did.XYFNKWTroy took the.punch and pulled back again with his free hand, opening it as he did, showing his terrible claws, claws that were surely going to disembowel the kid.XYFNKWSomehow.Jordan managed to grab the beast’s wrist and deflect the oncoming blow.XYFNKWOne claw managed to glance across Jordan’s side, drawing a line of blood.XYFNKWJordan winced from the pain, but took the opportunity to kick out at Troy’s leg.XYFNKWHe hit him solidly in the upper thigh which caused the monster to stumble a little..Troy quickly recovered and hoisted Jordan up by the neck and slammed him.against the wall.XYFNKWThe boy didn’t give in but continued to trade blows with the creature.XYFNKWBlood started to flow from both of their faces.XYFNKWJordan realized that the Centrigenix must also have pain dampening properties in order to endure this amount of punishment, as he seemed to be holding his own against the ferocious.beast..He felt Troy’s grip tightening, trying to close off his air supply.XYFNKWHe shot his.free hand up and grabbed the creature’s arm.XYFNKWHe started to press down with all.his enhanced might.XYFNKWThe strength of the two opponents seemed comparable to each other as Jordan couldn’t break the hold.XYFNKWHe dropped the bar and grabbed on.with his other hand and started to scream as he pressed down on the creature’s.wrist, trying to break the hold..Troy reached back with his other hand, winding up for another strike.XYFNKWJordan.started to gasp—Troy’s grip was beginning to have an affect and he couldn’t break the hold.XYFNKWHe could feel the creature’s claws digging into the back of his.neck as he continued to squeeze the life out of him..Troy roared!XYFNKWJordan knew that he was about to enter into darkness and he was certain he wouldn’t be coming out of it....26.A N S W E R S.Jordan gasped, trying desperately to get air into his lungs.XYFNKWTroy pulled back.his free arm and readied to deliver the final blow.XYFNKWThe beast snarled, but then suddenly glanced to the side..Dillon crashed into the creature and plunged the syringe into the arm.that was holding his brother.XYFNKWTroy instantly let go of Jordan and began to scream as he held his arm.XYFNKWJordan crumpled to the ground holding his throat and gasping.XYFNKWThe spider that was chasing Dillon leaped for the young boy, but Dillon pushed himself off of Troy and crashed hard on the ground.XYFNKWThe spider-creature.landed on the monster as it started to move away from the boys..The monster stumbled away screaming.XYFNKWHe looked in horror at his arm as it.actually combusted!XYFNKWThe spider tried to leap away but the flames quickly spread.and ignited it as well.XYFNKWIt squealed but still jumped for Dillon again.XYFNKWThe boy quickly shot out his foot and knocked it away.XYFNKWIt shrieked and then slumped to.the ground, being consumed by the fire..The flames quickly spread to all other parts of Troy’s body as he ran wildly.in any direction he could.XYFNKWThe screams were horrific!XYFNKWHe didn’t make it far before succumbing to his fate.XYFNKWThe smell of burning flesh quickly filled the air..Dillon went right to Jordan to see if he was okay.XYFNKWDerek stumbled to his feet.and stared at the combusting mass just a few feet away..Are you okay bro?XYFNKWDillon asked..Jordan nodded, unable to talk just yet..Relief hit him as he slump back, thankful that his brother was alright.XYFNKWThen it struck him.XYFNKWWait … we need to see if Gwen’s okay!XYFNKWDillon said urgently, remembering that his sister was stowed away in a cupboard..Dillon ran over as fast as he could and threw the cupboard doors open.XYFNKWGwen.shrieked.XYFNKWWhen she saw Dillon standing there she dropped the scalpel and launched herself at him.XYFNKWHe wrapped her in a big hug that seemed to last forever..You’re okay, he reassured her.XYFNKWWe all are..After what seemed a long while she finally let go.XYFNKWShe wiped the tears from.her eyes and followed her brother over to where Jordan and Derek were.XYFNKWShe ran.to Jordan and wrapped her arms around him..Come on everyone.XYFNKWWe have to go, said an insistent Tom Tom waving.them over from the other side of the room.XYFNKWHe and John were standing at the door on the opposite side of the room from where Dillon, Jordan, and Gwen came through earlier..Derek, the kids, and two of John’s team members who managed to survive the onslaught rushed over and, as Dillon was exiting the room, his eyes glanced.upon the smouldering mass of what remained of Troy’s monstrous body.XYFNKWAfter a.brief moment he turned and walked away, sealing that image in his mind..They walked through a corridor and came to another room which had the label Medical Aid written above it..We’ll look at everyone’s injuries here before we head back to the resort,.John explained as he opened the door..The room was large and well furnished with all the supplies they needed..Everyone found a cot to sit down on as John and his crew started to assess everyone’s injuries.XYFNKWThankfully, one of the men who had survived, Trevor, had medical training and started addressing the injuries..Good job Dillon.XYFNKWDerek congratulated as he sat beside him waiting for Trevor to get set up with his supplies.XYFNKWBut are you okay?XYFNKWhe asked sympathetically..Dillon looked at him for a long moment, not really understanding at first what Derek was asking.XYFNKWThen the realization of his question, and what he had just done, began to sink in as tears started to well up in his eyes..You had no choice, Derek said comfortingly.XYFNKWIt was either Troy or the rest of us..Dillon choked back the tears as his eyes went red and just nodded, fearing that he would burst out crying if he said a word.XYFNKWHe had just killed someone and a massive load of guilt started to well up inside of him..Who’s this?XYFNKWJohn asked as he approached with another first aid kit..This is Dillon Hunt.XYFNKWThe boy who is responsible for cracking all the clues.you left for us in order to find you, Derek replied.XYFNKWHe’s also primarily responsible for saving us with his quick thinking of using the Necrotoxin and the Genesis serum..Dillon knew that Derek was trying to justify his actions, but he wasn’t sure.he could ever feel good about the outcome of the choice he just made.XYFNKWIt all happened so fast and he didn’t consider the consequences until after the confrontation was in full swing.XYFNKWWas there a better way he could have handled the situation so that he wasn’t forced to take a life?XYFNKWCould he have used Jordan with his increased strength and speed to overpower everyone?XYFNKWOr was the action.that he took merely the action of a boy whose imagination was overactive which.clouded his judgement and caused him to make a rash decision?XYFNKWThese were the.thoughts—and many more like them—that spiralled through the young boy’s mind..Well then.XYFNKWI’m very pleased to meet you Dillon Hunt.XYFNKWAny relation to ….Derek put his hand on John’s arm and shook his head slightly in order to stop him from saying more a move that Dillon didn’t miss..You know Dillon, I’m impressed, John continued with a big smile.XYFNKWHow.did you know that the Necrotoxin wouldn’t react well with the Genesis serum?Dillon wiped his face with his shirt sleeve.XYFNKWThe little bit of information I was able to read about the chemicals in the lab said that they don’t react well together.XYFNKWI also saw one of the creatures combust just by touching Oasis land which I already knew was created by Genesis..John laughed.XYFNKWVery good!XYFNKWYou’re absolutely right.XYFNKWThese two chemicals.don’t react well together.XYFNKWIn fact, the Necrotoxin is made from the waste that is produced when Genesis is created.XYFNKWWith the addition of a couple more.compounds in the right quantities that act as reacting agents, even the slightest contact causes them to violently respond to one another.XYFNKWIt’s a bit of a failsafe I built into the Necrotoxin in order to make sure there was a way to manage the.creatures just in case any of them needed to be dealt with..You did that while under mind-control?XYFNKWDillon asked..John shrugged.XYFNKWI guess.XYFNKWI can’t explain how I managed it.XYFNKWIt was almost like.a waking dream most of the time.XYFNKWBut I guess that, just like some people learn to control parts of their dreams, I learned to control some parts of my actions.XYFNKWI couldn’t help but conform to their wishes, but part of me was able to control, to an extent, some of the outcome..The thing that strikes me as odd though, Derek interjected, is that this Tokala tribe doesn’t appear to me as having the ability to do all of this alone..That’s because they didn’t, came Tom Tom’s reply as he walked over to join the conversation.XYFNKWThere’s someone else behind this..Who?I don’t know.XYFNKWThe elders are really tight-lipped about it..Well that’s a problem, Derek stated matter-of-factly..So does that mean that the whole tribe who owns and runs the place was in.on it?No, not at all, Tom Tom replied, almost sheepishly.XYFNKWWe were deceived by.the elders of our tribe just as you and the rest of the world have been over the last number of years.XYFNKWThe elders came to us before we built any of the resort and explained that they had received a vision from the spirit animals that roamed these parts, and that they led them to a hidden oasis in the desert that no one knew about..Of course we were all skeptical at first, but when they showed it to us and.explained their vision of the future that they were going to revitalize our tribe through the management of this oasis, the creation of the hotel, and the land which they would give us to live in this paradise … we couldn’t refuse the offer..But why weren’t you able to storm in and find John without my help?asked Dillon, wondering where he fit into this.XYFNKWAnd why me?Derek looked to the others for a moment and then back to Dillon.XYFNKWWe couldn’t risk an overt assault as we didn’t know exactly what we were dealing with.XYFNKWWe had sent covert teams in over the course of almost eighteen months and.they found nothing.XYFNKWSo we needed a different approach—we needed you..Dillon’s face went pale.XYFNKWBut why me?XYFNKWhe blurted, almost feeling like he was on a roller coaster ride that he couldn’t get off.XYFNKWHow did you know I would be able to help?Because you have those special abilities we talked about and saw in action,.Derek replied.XYFNKWRemember that I told you that you were destined for something.greater?XYFNKWAs you get older it will all make more sense to you.XYFNKWI promise.XYFNKWWhen the time is right you will know.XYFNKWDerek put a hand on his shoulder and smiled..Come on, we need to get out of here so I can let our team know where this place is so we can clean it up.XYFNKWYou kids must be tired..Trevor and John bandaged up the group as best they could with the supplies.they had.XYFNKWThankfully no one was really that injured, even Jordan, whose body had started to heal itself with the aid of Centrigenix..Dillon had a thousand more questions he wanted to ask but somehow knew.he wouldn’t be getting any answers.XYFNKWHe resigned to the fact that he would have.to be patient and hopefully get those answers later—except for one..Why does the Takala tribe leave a symbol of a boxed-in pentagram with the.eye in the middle of it all over the place?John, Tom Tom, and Derek all stopped and looked at him in stunned silence..It was as if he had just dropped a bomb..What are you talking about?XYFNKWTom Tom asked..What?XYFNKWDerek asked as well..You know, the symbol on the wall at the front desk in the hotel, here in the.tunnel, and carved into the counter at the information center?That’s … Derek started to say.XYFNKWThat’s nothing, he said after he composed.himself..But what does it mean?XYFNKWDillon asked..I don’t know, Derek responded.XYFNKWBut I’m going to find out....27.T H E V A C A T I O N ’ S E N D.Dillon!XYFNKWDillon!XYFNKWhe heard someone say as he felt himself being.shaken..Dillon’s eyes started to flutter and then he had a sudden.feeling of dread.XYFNKWHis eyes popped open as he tried to back away from whatever it was that was shaking him..Whoa … easy..He felt disoriented and was sure that some sort of monster was trying to attack him.XYFNKWHis eyes darted around trying to find out where he was and what was.going on.XYFNKWAs he adjusted to his surroundings he realized that he was safe in his hotel room.XYFNKWDad was standing in front of him and smiling disarmingly at him..It’s just me.XYFNKWDad..Dillon looked around skeptically but quickly realized that he actually was in.his room.XYFNKWHis brother Jordan was snoring loudly in the bed next to him..You kids need to get up, Dad said as he pulled back the curtains to the room and let the sunlight flood in.XYFNKWJordan flinched and moaned as though he was.a creature of the night who despised the light..Come on Jordan!XYFNKWDad hollered at him as he took his pillow and hit him a.couple of times with it.XYFNKWFinally Jordan’s eyes opened slowly..Somehow, he managed to pull himself up.XYFNKWAll Dillon could think about was.the crash that John said he would experience from the Centrigenix..What is it?XYFNKWJordan managed to mumble..We’re half way through our vacation and Mom and I have planned an awesome hike to the hot springs, with lunch, and a tour around the outskirts of.the Oasis,.Dillon rubbed his face.XYFNKWHe wasn’t too keen on seeing more of this place after.the events of last night.XYFNKWIn truth, he was ready to go home..Come on guys!XYFNKWIt’s going to be fun, but we need to get moving if we’re going to have time to do everything, Dad exclaimed..Dillon didn’t know what to think.XYFNKWHow was Jordan going to make such a trip.in his condition?So come on guys.XYFNKWI want you up and down stairs in an hour so we can get.moving on this, Dad said as he headed for the door..After he was gone, Dillon went over to his brother who looked like he lapsed.back into a coma.XYFNKWHey Jordan.XYFNKWAre you gonna be alright?XYFNKWThat Centrigenix really kicked your butt!Jordan looked over at his little brother his eyes were a little bloodshot..What are you talking about?XYFNKWhe asked.XYFNKWCentri … what …?Dillon thought Jordan was messing with him at first, but when he mentioned.the weird creatures they battled, and the monster who used to be the gate keeper Troy, and how Jordan had super-human power to help defeat the creatures, his brother scoffed at him..You and your imagination, he said as he rolled back over and pulled the pillow over his head..Dillon sat back, not quite understanding what was going on.XYFNKWThen he.remembered that after they got out of the the main lab, they went to another smaller room with more lab equipment where John was able to use some sort of.chemical compound to break down the neurogenic implant in himself and Gwen.so that they wouldn’t be subject to being controled anymore.XYFNKWAfter he was done,.he also said that he needed to inject Gwen and Jordan with another mixture which was supposed to help them both overcome any of the possible side effects.of having the invasive materials inside of them, and to help Jordan recover easier when the Centrigenix wore off..Dillon wondered if any of those injections could be the cause of the apparent..memory loss.XYFNKWHe needed to find out.XYFNKWHe needed to see Gwen right away..BOY, WHAT IS IT WITH THESE KIDS TODAY?XYFNKWDILLON HEARD HIS DAD SAY TO.himself as he saw him coming out of the girl’s room..Everything okay Dad?XYFNKWhe asked as he approached the room..Oh, it’s okay.XYFNKWJust dealing with kids that don’t want to get up, even though.it’s already ten..Let me see if I can help, Dillon said as he moved passed Dad and pushed.the door open.XYFNKWTime to rise and shine!XYFNKWhe yelled as he came into their room and jumped on the nearest bed.XYFNKWClaire groaned.XYFNKWGwen didn’t look much better when he promptly jumped over and began to shake her..After about five minutes of shaking and yelling he realized that it wasn’t going to work.XYFNKWHe left the room and went to find Dad..Hey Dad, he called out as he entered his parent’s room.XYFNKWJordan and Gwen.don’t look well.XYFNKWMaybe they came down with a bug or something?XYFNKWI think we’ll.have to postpone our day trip..Oh … okay, Dad replied, looking a little dejected.XYFNKWI guess we’ll just have.to find something else to do until they get better..That’s one of the things that Dillon really liked about his Dad, he always tried to look for the silver lining in his experiences..I’ll go and check on them and see if they need anything, said Mom as she.moved passed Dillon and into the hall..Dillon offered his Dad a little smile before exiting..Jordan ended up staying in bed that entire day.XYFNKWWhen Gwen finally got up at.the crack of 3:00, Dillon managed to have some conversations with her and probed her about the night before without saying anything too definite about what happened.XYFNKWHe asked questions such as: How was your night?XYFNKWWhat did you do?XYFNKWWhat time did you get to bed at?XYFNKWWho were you with?XYFNKWThe answers she.gave definitely told him that she too was experiencing memory loss.XYFNKWThe troubling question he had was: Why did Derek and John leave his memories.intact?He still had a ton of unanswered questions he wanted to ask Derek, but in truth, he didn’t even know if he would see him again.XYFNKWThe whole thing was a whirlwind almost dreamlike.XYFNKWThe only troubling fact was that he knew it wasn’t.a dream.XYFNKWDillon had definitely been in danger multiple times throughout his time here or at least that’s what he thought.XYFNKWHe started to doubt the experiences of the last few days.XYFNKWWas he really in danger?XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWThen he noticed the lines of cuts on his hand where the spider had gotten him.XYFNKWNo.XYFNKWHe knew that.it was real.XYFNKWHe knew he had experienced real fear, and he definitely was responsible for the death of Troy.XYFNKWThe problem was that he couldn’t tell anyone.about it..He spent most of that night by himself, laying by the pool and contemplating.his recent experiences.XYFNKWHe laughed at Dad’s jokes and enjoyed seeing his sister.have fun in the pool.XYFNKWMost of it was an act as he really didn’t feel like laughing..He really enjoyed watching his little sister have fun given the fact that she could have been seriously hurt or killed the night before, and she didn’t even seem to remember it.XYFNKWPerhaps it was for the best.XYFNKWHe almost wished that his memories would be taken from him that he could have the images he saw scrubbed from.his mind..It was during this contemplative time that he knew what he had to do when.he got home: he had to confide in Sarah.XYFNKWHe knew that she would believe him..She was his best friend the only friend he could count on one hundred percent..You okay Dillon?XYFNKWcame Mom’s soft voice.XYFNKWYou look depressed or.something..Ya … of course I’m good.XYFNKWJust a little tired.XYFNKWThat’s all..Okay honey.XYFNKWJust so you know, I’m here for you if you want to talk, she ended as she got up and strolled over to the edge of the pool..Sure!XYFNKWDillon thought.XYFNKWHey mom.XYFNKWI just want to let you know that this place was created by a chemical serum called Genesis which was stolen by some madmen.XYFNKWI fought a bunch of creatures which were created by a by-product of the serum called Necrotoxin Jordan juiced himself up with Centrigenix and was awesome at fighting battles in an underground secret lab where him, Gwen, and..I were almost killed!XYFNKWOh yeah … I guess I forgot to mention that your youngest daughter had a mind control chip implanted in her which made her turn against Jordan and I!XYFNKWOh and … by the way … both of them have had their memories erased which means you need to take my word for it.XYFNKWAnd don’t forget the fact that this whole family vacation was setup in order for a secretive group called Orion to get me here because I, apparently, have some sort of special ability to uncover clues or something like that.XYFNKWYa … I’m sure she would listen!Dillon chuckled to himself..What a ride!XYFNKWhe thought to himself.XYFNKWWhat a ride indeed!THE FINAL WEEK OF THE HUNT FAMILY VACATION WAS UNEVENTFUL WHICH WAS.quite alright with Dillon.XYFNKWThings seemed to be back to normal: Jordan was back.to his irritating self, Gwen was as playful as ever, and Claire was … well ….Claire.XYFNKWThey were able to go on their hike, enjoy the springs, and see the rest of the sights..Dillon conspicuously noted the absence of the bike shop lady, Tara.XYFNKWHe was.sure that Orion was dealing with all those shady figures who were behind the whole Oasis thing.XYFNKWThat brought some disturbing thoughts to him regarding the.future of the resort.XYFNKWHe wondered if the place was going to get shut down and what was going to become of all those who lived here?XYFNKWFrom what he gathered,.most of the residents were completely innocent..It was actually a weird feeling to be finally enjoying himself.XYFNKWIt took a couple of days but he stopped looking over his shoulder or jumping at every sound while they were hiking through the forest.XYFNKWThe best part about it was that Dillon didn’t have anymore strange dreams.XYFNKWThat was a total relief to him!He really wished that he had an opportunity to talk to Derek, or someone, about his dreams, but he felt so strange about them that he was afraid to even mention them.XYFNKWHe couldn’t figure out how they could have been so real in picturing events that eventually formed into some sort of reality—not exactly as he pictured them but in rough form.XYFNKWHe definitely had a hard time thinking that..anyone would believe him, and he didn’t want to be labeled as a crackpot.XYFNKWThe.only people who might even entertain the fact that they were real were probably.Derek and Sarah, and he never had a chance to speak with Derek about it..He reasoned at that moment that if he had the courage to, he would talk to Sarah about it.XYFNKWHe knew she would understand..DILLON THREW HIS CLOTHES INTO HIS SUIT CASE HAPHAZARDLY.XYFNKWHE TRIED TO.separate the dirty ones from the clean ones, but he wasn’t really concerned about it he knew Mom would take care of that when they got home.XYFNKWHe tossed a pair.of pants into the suitcase and heard something hard fall onto the ground.XYFNKWHe looked down and noticed JTS’s watch.XYFNKWHe reached down and scooped it up.XYFNKWHe.knew he had given all of John’s stuff back, including the watch..How did this get in my pants?XYFNKWhe mumbled to himself..He went back into the case and started rummaging around to see if there was.anything else unusual in any of his other clothes.XYFNKWNothing.XYFNKWHe held the watch up before him and opened it.XYFNKWA small slip of paper dropped out.XYFNKWHe picked it up and unfolded it.XYFNKWIt was a letter from Derek!DILLON,.THE ORION GROUP WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENT EFFORT IN.helping us with this case.XYFNKWBecause of you many people were spared and you helped avert a possible catastrophe as we have learned that Troy and the others behind The Oasis Resort were planning on weaponizing the Necrotoxin and selling it to those who have no conscience about using it to harm others..More than that, I would like to thank you for your help personally.XYFNKWYou excelled beyond all of my expectations with your skill and resourcefulness.XYFNKWI am sorry that your brother and sister got involved.XYFNKWAs it turned out, Jordan ended up..being one of the biggest assets in helping us win.XYFNKWIt’s too bad we had to wipe his memory of those heroic events.XYFNKWIt’s for his own good..I know that you have many more questions that weren’t answered.XYFNKWYou need.to be patient.XYFNKWThose answers will come in time.XYFNKWUntil then, take care of yourself Dillon Hunt..YOUR FRIEND ALWAYS,.DEREK VICO.DILLON PONDERED THE LETTER FOR A LONG TIME.XYFNKWIT SEEMED TO SUGGEST TO HIM.that he hadn’t seen the last of Derek and this Orion Group.XYFNKWHe tucked the letter away in a safe place and carried on with getting his stuff packed..As he continued to pack he didn’t notice his sister, Claire, staring at him through his partially closed door.XYFNKWShe watched as he placed the letter and watch in a side pocket of the suitcase.XYFNKWIf Dillon wasn’t so occupied with the thoughts that were whirling through his mind as he considered the contents of the letter he might have noticed Claire’s glowing yellow eyes as she peered at him through the cracked door..AS DILLON CAME BACK INTO THE LOBBY AFTER PUTTING THE LAST OF THE BAGS.in the van he saw Tom Tom standing behind the front desk with Janeen.XYFNKWDad seemed to be conversing with him easily.XYFNKWDillon ran over to the old man.XYFNKWHe hadn’t seen him since that fateful night when they just barely made it out of the lab alive..Tom Tom!XYFNKWhe yelled as he hurried over.XYFNKWWhen he approached the desk he.composed himself, trying hard not to seem too excited to see his new friend..Hi Dillon, Tom Tom said to the young boy..Hey.XYFNKWHow are you feeling?Feeling?XYFNKWTom Tom replied, raising an eyebrow..I mean … he began, … the last I heard of you is that you weren’t feeling.well.XYFNKWBut of course that was a week ago.XYFNKWGood cover!XYFNKWhe thought to himself..Oh yes.XYFNKWI’m quite well.XYFNKWAs a matter of fact, I was just telling your Dad that I have been named the next Executive Officer of the resort..What!XYFNKWThat’s awesome!XYFNKWDillon responded, not able to contain his.enthusiasm..What’s more is that Tom Tom here has just informed me that our family has.been drawn in some sort of guest lottery which means that we have won all-expenses paid vacations here every year for the next five years!XYFNKWDad exclaimed..Dillon was speechless!That’s right Dillon, said Tom Tom, it’s the least we could do to show our.appreciation to one of our guest families especially one as deserving as yours..He winked at Dillon, a sign the young boy didn’t miss..You’re too kind, Dad said appreciatively.XYFNKWThank you..No.XYFNKWIt’s the least we could do.XYFNKWHe turned back to Dillon.XYFNKWI guess we’ll see.you again then Dillon..Dillon smiled widely.XYFNKWIt sounded to him like things at the resort were going.to be alright after all..As his family rolled through the gate and onto the highway that led through.the desert, Dillon looked back.XYFNKWHe really didn’t know what had just happened to.him over the last two weeks it all seemed surreal.XYFNKWWhat he did know, however,.is that things would never be the same for him again....E P I L O G U E.Jake opened the large doors which led to the study..The size of the doors were an indication to the grandness of the library.which lay beyond.XYFNKWThere were large vaulted rows of shelves stretching the.entire length of the massive room.XYFNKWAt the very end of the room was an enormous window through which multitudes of radiant rays from the sun rained.down illuminating the inside of the chamber with its warmth..Down the middle of the room were large tables, most of which had an assortment of books, maps, and other rolled parchment strewn about them in no.discernible pattern.XYFNKWThe place resembled an archaic library that housed ancient books of ages gone by.XYFNKWThere were, however, on one of the tables an array of computer equipment that added a modern touch to the ambiance of the aged place..Standing to the side of one of the computers was a man who appeared to be.deep in thought as he looked down at a large opened book.XYFNKWThe man had short.cropped white hair, a medium-lengthed white beard, and was wearing a set of large round glasses that were sitting on the end of his nose which allowed his eyes to glance overtop them as he read the information from the book he had open before him.XYFNKWHe had on a sweater overtop a collared shirt, and his pants appeared to be beige Kakis.XYFNKWSitting on the table just above the book was a small stone statue..As Jake approached, he saw the man glance up from his work, apparently.alerted by his presence.XYFNKWHello Stephen, greeted Jake..Stephen didn’t appear overly happy to see the agent of Orion.XYFNKWWhat are you.doing here?XYFNKWhe asked as he slammed the book shut, his voice full of accusation..When he spoke he articulated his words in such a way that one could tell that he was well educated and probably came from a well-refined upperclass society..Come now, aren’t you glad to see me?XYFNKWcame Jake’s reply, trying to sound.as though he was wounded by the cold greeting..Stephen seemed to soften up a bit.XYFNKWSorry, he replied.XYFNKWIt’s just that I’m in.the middle of something and the answers aren’t coming as fluidly as they used.to.XYFNKWIt’s actually quite maddening!Jake didn’t say a word, but appeared as if he was interested.XYFNKWThis was his way of coaxing others to speak.XYFNKWHe often didn’t have to ask what their issues were, he would just wait and portray having a sympathetic ear which would cause them to just open up to him..I have this relic here, Stephen started to say, well … it’s actually a copy of a relic, he picked it up off the table..It was a small statue about eight inches high and appeared to be in the shape.of a woman holding a small gem out in front of her with both hands.XYFNKWStephen held it up in order for Jake to get a better look at it..You see this here, he said, pointing at the gem.XYFNKWJake nodded.XYFNKWWe are unsure if she is offering this to someone or if she is using it in some way..Jake looked confused.XYFNKWDoes it matter?Does it matter!?XYFNKWOf course it matters!XYFNKWWe think that this is one of the rouge.stones from myth, but we aren’t sure … I’m not sure, his voice trailed off, showing his frustration with his lack of knowledge..Jake stayed silent, giving him a moment to compose himself..According to legend, the rouge stones are in the custody of guardians of some sort, but—so the tales say—one of them is missing and there are rumours.that it was given to someone so they could hide it.XYFNKWHe put the statue down.XYFNKWIn truth, we don’t know if any of this is accurate or not, and the literature I have doesn’t provide any clues.XYFNKWIf the guardians do exist then they have done a fantastic job keeping their whereabouts and society a secret..We have reason to believe they exist, Jake said unwaveringly.XYFNKWWhat we don’t know are the specifics Dr.XYFNKWSpecifics which you need to get for us..What reasons do you have?XYFNKWasked Stephen..That is classified, said Jake with a smile..Great!XYFNKWThat’s not helpful..Jake leaned on the table.XYFNKWWhat about your … powers?XYFNKWCan’t you utilize those to assist you in your research?Stephen scoffed.XYFNKWWhat powers?XYFNKWThose have faded away a long time ago..Jake smiled.XYFNKWDon’t worry, we’ve found someone else who has your unique.abilities..The Dr.XYFNKWlooked at Jake suspiciously.XYFNKWWho?Jake’s smile got even wider, Dillon Hunt..Stephen rocked back a step.XYFNKWHis face went pale and displayed a look of absolute horror.XYFNKWNo!XYFNKWYou can’t!XYFNKWHe’s only a boy..Yes … a very resourceful boy.XYFNKWHe was immensely helpful in helping us get.back the Genesis serum.XYFNKWHe paused for effect.XYFNKWAs a matter of fact, a couple of the Hunt kids were very helpful..You can’t, Stephen whimpered, tears welling up in his eyes..Unfortunately Dillon’s father, Bruce, never inherited these traits.XYFNKWThey say.that sometimes these things skip a generation, Jake said as he picked up the replica statue..I won’t cooperate anymore if you drag him into this, the Dr.XYFNKWspouted..Oh … I think you will, replied Jake.XYFNKWDillon will help us whether you will.or not.XYFNKWIt might be in your best interest for you to play along with us Dr.XYFNKWHunt..Don’t worry, we won’t use Dillon for this mission just yet, he stated, indicating the statue he was holding.XYFNKWWe have other plans and items we need him to find first..Dr.XYFNKWHunt slumped down into a nearby chair, unable to say anything.XYFNKWHe never.wanted his grandson to be involved with Orion.XYFNKWHe always wished that the traits.he acquired would stop with him, but apparently they hadn’t.XYFNKWDillon was now marked as an asset by Orion.XYFNKWAn asset, he knew, they would exploit to the best of their ability..Hero Wanted..I am not a bad man, Lord Robert, the King's Sculptor said..The Lord High Sculptor's companion, who was altogether unremarkable, nodded his head, not in agreement, but to convince the artist to get to the point.XYFNKWGive him a King or a merchant who would just say 'Go and kill so and so.'.The King wants another statue for the Garden of Heroes, the sculptor said.XYFNKWThere are eight figures on the north side, and only seven on the south, Bob nodded again.XYFNKWThere are only fifteen great heroes in our tradition.XYFNKWWe need to create a new hero..Why do you need me to make up a hero?No, no, no.XYFNKWIt must be an authentic hero.XYFNKWThat is where you come in.XYFNKWYou need to start a war.XYFNKWNot a big war, I don't want too much trouble, but enough of a conflict to allow someone to rise to the occasion.XYFNKWGo look at the Garden and you will see what I need..Bob made his escape and visited the Garden of Heroes.XYFNKWHe thought of himself as a hardened killer, but those statues turned his stomach.XYFNKWEach of the fifteen heroes was shown dying in extreme agony.XYFNKWOne was being torn apart by huge wolves, another was filled with countless arrows.XYFNKWThe worst part was that Bob began to see how he could accomplish the task.....The war with the trolls began through a series of tragic misunderstandings.XYFNKWA hunting party found itself on troll territory.XYFNKWIt wouldn't have been so bad if the trolls hadn't taken all the horses to eat, or if the King's nephew hadn't been breaking in his favourite horse..That incident might have been forgotten, if a party of trolls hadn't missed the boundary stones and wandered into the kingdom.XYFNKWUnfortunately, they bumped into the nephew who decided to find out whether trolls truly turned to stone in sunlight.XYFNKWThey do..Things went downhill from there.....Bob sat polishing his commander's boots.XYFNKWHe was annoyed, so he was smiling.XYFNKWThe war was rolling along, but in spite of all his maneuvering no heroes had risen to the occasion.XYFNKWSeveral soldiers had died, but none gruesomely enough or at an important enough point in the conflict.XYFNKWAll Bob's efforts to push this new commander into heroics had failed.XYFNKWLord Robert was getting impatient..It was time for another move.....Bob cursed his stupidity.XYFNKWA border war was bad enough, but this was an all-out invasion.XYFNKWHe sent a scout to warn the army, but it would be daylight before they arrived.XYFNKWOnly one hope remained.XYFNKWThere was stone bridge across a gorge that his squad might be able to hold.XYFNKWKiller he might be, but he didn't want to be ruled by trolls..They refused to meet the strong but ungainly trolls head on.XYFNKWThey tripped them and tangled their feet with rope.XYFNKWBob and his crew fought through the night backing up inch by inch.XYFNKWOne by one they fell.XYFNKWFinally, only Bob remained.XYFNKWIn the gray dawn, he fell.XYFNKWAs a troll roared in triumph and went to stomp on him, the sun rose.XYFNKWPetrified troll blocked the bridge.....The commander came to the Lord High Sculptor..Bob was a great hero, but he asked me to tell you he plans to die of old age in bed.XYFNKWI didn't understand until he explained everything..Lord Robert paled as soldiers pulled up a troll frozen in mid stomp..The King thought the empty place could be filled with an object lesson....Straw into Gold..Fiona lived with her parents in their little croft at the edge of a marsh.XYFNKWEvery morning she'd comb out the wool from their sheep.XYFNKWEvery afternoon she'd spin the wool into thread.XYFNKWEvery evening she'd weave the threads into good wool cloth..One day the Laird came riding up to the gate..Hello, the Laird called out.XYFNKWI am looking for a good wool cloak.XYFNKWFiona came out from her work and brought cool water from the well..I am sure Fiona will weave her best for you.XYFNKWHer father smiled and shooed her back into the croft.XYFNKWShe can weave gold from straw..Well, the Laird's ears perked up.XYFNKWHe had money needs of his own to be sure..I do need a new cloak, but I need gold even more.XYFNKWThe Laird stood.XYFNKWBring her by the castle and we will see.XYFNKWHe fixed Fiona's father with a fierce glare.XYFNKWDo not disappoint me, or it will be worse for you..When Fiona's father told her what he had done, she wept bitterly, but they were caught.XYFNKWIn the morning, she walked down the road with eyes dry and mind working furiously.XYFNKWTo get to the Laird's castle they had to pass by the black marsh.XYFNKWAt lunch, she sat by the dark water..Foolish, foolish, foolish, she muttered.XYFNKWWho would dream of weaving gold from straw?Not so hard if you know the trick, a voice said from the water.XYFNKWFiona started and looked around, but saw only rocks, trees, and her sleeping father..Would it be a trick that you could teach me?XYFNKWasked the girl..For a price, said the voice.XYFNKWIt is an easy enough thing.XYFNKWGo on to the Laird's castle and I will come to you there..Fiona continued to the Laird's castle.XYFNKWShe arrived in the evening, and was shown into a cold room with a hard mat on the floor.XYFNKWIn the morning, a servant came and took Fiona to a room filled with straw.XYFNKWThe Laird waited for her at the door..If you can weave this into gold, well and good.XYFNKWIf not he shrugged and left, locking the door behind him..Fiona looked at the room and felt her heart sink.XYFNKWIt just wasn't possible..Foolish, foolish, foolish, she muttered.XYFNKWIf you are here, I could use your help..Close your eyes, the voice said.XYFNKWShe closed them tight, and a gentle hand led her to a chair.XYFNKWTake the comb, and comb at the straw, but see in your mind the finest wool.XYFNKWBut you must keep your eyes closed the whole day..What is the price for your help?XYFNKWFiona asked..The merest trifle, whispered the voice.XYFNKWJust a kiss..Fiona tilted her head up and felt the brush of lips across her own..All day she combed the straw as if it were the finest wool with her eyes tight closed.XYFNKWJust as the light faded, the voice whispered..Open your eyes.XYFNKWThe room was filled with the finest wool all combed and cleaned..Where is the gold?XYFNKWthe Laird demanded, his eyes dark..You see wool where you had straw, Fiona said.XYFNKWCan you not be content?A servant took her back to a chamber with a fire and soft mattress..The next morning, she was taken back to the room..Today I want to see gold.XYFNKWthe Laird pushed into the room and slammed the door..Foolish, foolish, foolish, Fiona whispered.XYFNKWIf you are here I could use your help..Once again the voice instructed her and led her with eyes shut to the chair.XYFNKWOnce again the hand was gentle and the kiss a mere brush of lips.XYFNKWAgain, Fiona worked, eyes closed, spinning the wool into thread.XYFNKWAnd again, as the last wool came off the wheel, the Laird burst into the room..Where is the gold?You see thread where you had straw.XYFNKWCan you not be content?.If I see gold tomorrow, the Laird said, I will marry you...The servant led her to a fine suite with a bath and meal laid out.XYFNKWYet Fiona lay awake all night.XYFNKWIn the morning when she was brought to the room, she walked to the chair and began weaving at the loom.XYFNKWAll day with her eyes open she weaved thread into good wool cloth.XYFNKWJust as the last light was leaving the room, she closed her eyes and whispered..If you are here, I would speak with you..I am here, whispered the voice..What happens if I open my eyes?XYFNKWFiona asked..Then I must leave you forever, the voice whispered..Then I will keep my eyes closed, but I want to go with you..Do you not want to marry the Laird?I would rather a gentle hand and loving kiss..The gentle hand led her out of the room, out of the castle to the edge of the marsh..Kiss me, the voice said..She kissed him, with lips and heart together..You may open your eyes..She saw a figure before her, not quite a man, not quite anything else..What do I call you?XYFNKWFiona asked..I am the Glothogach..Then I will be the Glothogach's wife, Fiona took his hand..What of the Laird?XYFNKWthe Glothogach asked..If he can't make gold out of good wool cloth, he isn't much of a Laird....Red Hat..The small group huddled around their tiny campfire.XYFNKWThough the rain had stopped the temperature plummeted.XYFNKWDwarves are a hardy bunch, but the combination of cold damp weather and lack of success prospecting for new ores made these ones as miserable and short tempered as any thin blooded human..We're going to be out of wood before the night is out, the one with the longest beard said.XYFNKWRed Hat, go and fetch some more..Oh sure, I would love to haul myself back down the mountain to pick up a few sticks, then climb back up in the dark.XYFNKWI told you to put some in your packs, but no, you're too high and mighty to carry firewood.XYFNKWThe red hatted dwarf pulled his hat tighter about his ears and hunched closer to the fire...You're a dwarf, you can see in the dark, another dwarf nudged him ungently with her foot.XYFNKWYou're wearing the red hat you go get firewood...You didn't tell me that when you gave me the hat, the hat wearer grumbled.XYFNKWYou just said it would keep me warm..Well, you'll be warm enough going down the mountain, one of the other dwarves said.XYFNKWWe all took our turns wearing the red hat..Muttering under his breath the youngest dwarf stood up and started back along the path.XYFNKWHe had got as far as the rock face with the odd vein running through it when a loud crack startled him.XYFNKWHe peered around hoping it was a stick that he had dropped.XYFNKWAll he saw were flakes of rock on the path.XYFNKWThere was another crack and a flake fell to the ground in front of him.XYFNKWHe looked up the rock face to see where it had come from..Hey, he yelled.XYFNKWCome look at this..Wood, Red Hat, The other dwarves yelled.XYFNKWGo get some..No, there's a hand coming out of the rock.XYFNKWThe dwarves around the fire made derisive noises..He stumped back to the fire and grabbed the only remaining long piece of burning wood.XYFNKWThe others tried to grab him but he ran back to the rock-face..See look, in that black vein.XYFNKWHe waved his makeshift torch.XYFNKWThe others crowded around him, the cold forgotten..It's moving...The hand was as large as their heads, and it opened and closed, twisted and contorted.XYFNKWEach time it moved, more rock would fall to the ground.XYFNKWGradually it became clear of the rock.XYFNKWThey watched as huge rough fingers gripped the rock and strained as if to pull the rock back in.XYFNKWBut it wasn't pulling rock in, it was pulling something out.XYFNKWSoon they could see a thick wrist then a forearm.XYFNKWEach time it pulled it had a longer reach.XYFNKWSoon the arm up to the elbow stuck out of the rock.XYFNKWIt bent and they could see sinews bunch and move in effort.XYFNKWThe rest of the arm and a shoulder appeared.XYFNKWAnother massive heave and a rock the size of Red Hat popped out of the vein.XYFNKWIt shook itself and roared...Oh slag heaps, one of the dwarves moaned.XYFNKWIt's a troll..The troll rolled its head on its shoulders while flakes of rock fell from its face.XYFNKWIts eyes opened and it saw the dwarves.XYFNKWQuicker than they thought possible it snatched at the group.XYFNKWThey jumped back stumbling over each other.XYFNKWThe troll's hand waved a dwarf's red hat about..Great, now my ears are cold.XYFNKWHe darted forward and waved the torch in the troll's face, but with a huge crack the other arm popped out of the rock and almost captured the young dwarf.XYFNKWWith a squeak, he scuttled away.XYFNKWHead and shoulders free, the troll began to heave the rest of itself out of the rock...It is time we were going, the oldest dwarf said.XYFNKWWe don't want to be here when it gets clear of that cliff.XYFNKWThe others looked at him and jogged back to the remains of their fire.XYFNKWIn minutes, they had packed up their gear and headed along the trail back down the mountain.XYFNKWThe troll's arm snaked out and grabbed Red Hat's backpack.XYFNKWHe wormed out of it just before the troll pulled him back to the rock.XYFNKWHis companions pulled him out of the way before the other hand could grab him.XYFNKWThey headed the other way up the trail...Red Hat was in the back trying to keep up with a twisted ankle.XYFNKWThe troll would pull the rest of itself free of the rock.XYFNKWThen, hungry from its efforts, the troll would chase after the dwarves to crush them and eat them.XYFNKWMaybe if he slowed down it would give the others time to get away..Keep up.XYFNKWI haven't lost a Red Hat yet, and I won't start tonight.XYFNKWThe oldest dwarf passed his mountain stick back to the young dwarf..Here, this way, called the lead dwarf.XYFNKWCareful though.XYFNKWThey crept out across a snowfield.XYFNKWBy now the troll was close behind them, but its much greater weight caused the snow to give way and with a final roar it disappeared down the mountain..When I was Red hat, the oldest dwarf said, I put a dragon's egg on the fire.Huddled together, the dwarves told stories 'till dawn....Swan Brothers..If my Da had any fault it was he boasted too much about his sons.XYFNKWMy brothers were kind when they thought of it, but mostly they never noticed me..One day a Queen came to see these fine lads.XYFNKWAs fair and chill as diamonds she was.XYFNKWI met her at the door.XYFNKWI who was never a part of my Da's boasting, being but a daughter..The Queen walked into our hut and looked at each of my brothers straight in the eye, and each, from oldest to youngest dropped their gaze before her..I offered her tea and sat her at our rough table.XYFNKWSeeing our visitor well seated, and likely well drowned by my chatter, my brothers went back to what they do best.XYFNKWThat is to talk about what they would do when the world was right and they were rich as kings...I saw the first storm cloud cross the fair brow of that Queen.XYFNKWShe wasn't pleased to be left to a chattering girl while the men ignored her.XYFNKWQueens aren't used to being ignored...She stood up abruptly and set the dishes to clattering.XYFNKWI saw the storm darken and lightening ready to strike..Please, O Queen, I begged, Don't hurt them..These are your sons?XYFNKWshe asked my father in her cold voice.XYFNKWI don't see much to boast of.XYFNKWMy seven brothers looked up, only now aware of their danger, but all too late.XYFNKWShe waved her hand at them and they fell to the ground.XYFNKWFeathers covered them.XYFNKWBefore I could take a breath, they had been changed into swans.XYFNKWIn a rush my brothers flew out the door leaving only my Da with his mouth hanging open, the Queen with darkness still flashing from her eyes, and seven white feathers lying by the hearth..What have I done?XYFNKWmy father moaned as he threw himself at her feet..You have been foolish, as only mortal men can be foolish, replied the Queen.XYFNKWNow only one thing may repair your boasting.XYFNKWShe looked at me...My father stared at me then at the Queen...Her?Her..The Queen came over and took me by the chin and looked deep into my eyes, indeed into my very soul..If Meg here stays silent for seven years, she might restore her brothers.XYFNKWShe must sew each of them a shirt from the nettles that grow upon the hills.XYFNKWShe looked at me again.XYFNKWYou must pick the nettles, spin the thread, and weave the cloth with your own hands.XYFNKWNot a whisper or a sigh may pass your lips..I opened my mouth, then closed it again.XYFNKWShe nodded at me and touched my lips with a finger, then vanished..I once woke with words already on my lips, and fell asleep with my sentence unfinished.XYFNKWNow a rock was not more silent than I.XYFNKWMy Da would rise in the morning and look at me, then lie himself back down again.XYFNKWHe took himself off to join Ma in heaven before the end of the first year...I wandered the hills to gather nettles.XYFNKWI bit my lips against letting a whimper out as they stung.XYFNKWMy hands were soon red and swollen.XYFNKWIn the evenings, I would pound the bitter stalks until they split and I could spin thread from them.XYFNKWThe thread I tied on a loom my Ma had left me and wove into cloth.XYFNKWThat was my life for six years...In the seventh year, a young man came to our village.XYFNKWHe was near as quiet as I had become, helping neighbour and friend.XYFNKWOf course, he came to see me.XYFNKWI was the village boast now.XYFNKWMad Meg, who hadn't made a sound in six years.XYFNKWThey made a game of it, trying to trick me into speech.XYFNKWAll failed...Bran came to watch me weave.XYFNKWHe talked softly of his day, while I sent the shuttle flying back and forth on the loom.XYFNKWI was working on the cloth for the last shirt - for my little brother.XYFNKWSo the days passed, and Bran fell in love with Mad Meg, and I with him.XYFNKWHe poured his heart out to me begging for a word of love.XYFNKWI stayed silent, and the day before seven years was done, he walked out of my house.XYFNKWSeeing his back disappear down the road I came closest to breaking my silence.XYFNKWStill, I let my heart break in silence...At last the morning it waited for came, and I took the shirts and the feathers outside to wait.XYFNKWSeven swans came with the smallest a bit behind.XYFNKWI cast the shirts over their heads.XYFNKWAs each one returned to himself, he would look at me and shake his head, then go into the house..The last one, the shirt was too small.XYFNKWI had forgotten how even little brothers grow.XYFNKWI left him with one arm and one wing.XYFNKWI crumpled and wept silent tears into the dust.XYFNKWMy brother lifted me up..Thank you, Meg, he whispered.XYFNKWI saw a man with sad eyes on the road.XYFNKWHe pointed with his wing.XYFNKWI am thinking you need him more than we need you..I gave him a hug and ran off away to find my love..My first words would be his....Albert..Once upon a time there lived a frog named Albert.XYFNKWAlbert was quite content as a frog.XYFNKWHe had his lily pad, his friends and a wonderful voice.XYFNKWEverybody knows that frogs are great singers, but Albert's voice was something special.XYFNKWWhenever he sang the whole pond would stop and listen to him sing.XYFNKWAlbert sang about the moon shining on the pond at night, about sleeping warm in the mud through the winter and about bathing in the warm light of the sun.XYFNKWIt was in fact, Albert's voice that got him into trouble...In a castle, up on a hill, overlooking Albert's pond, lived a King and his family.XYFNKWThe royal family lived content, with the exception of the youngest daughter whose name was Sue.XYFNKWWhere princesses were supposed to be graceful and composed, Sue was somewhat ungainly and terribly shy.XYFNKWSomehow she never acted quite like a princess should.XYFNKWHer brothers and sisters taunted her unmercifully.XYFNKWEven the servants in the castle teased her...One spring evening when the air was especially still she stood on the balcony of her room listening to the sounds of the spring night.XYFNKWSince her room overlooked the pond, she of course heard Albert singing..Even a frog has something special that makes him sing so beautifully, she sighed and leaned her head against the cool glass.XYFNKWI wish I knew what that frog is singing about so wonderfully.XYFNKWShe shook her head.XYFNKWWhat nonsense I am thinking tonight to envy a frog his voice.XYFNKWShe turned to go into her room.XYFNKWJust as she was closing the doors behind her she heard a beautiful bass voice singing of the joy of spring under the first star of the night.XYFNKWTransfixed the princess stood and listened to the velvety voice..O dear me, you will catch your death of cold..Sue jumped and turned to her nurse...You startled me.XYFNKWShe closed the doors and came into the room.XYFNKWShe stretched and gave a tremendous yawn.XYFNKWI'm so tired...Such a yawn for a princess.XYFNKWHer nurse clucked and helped her change for sleep.XYFNKWIt isn't at all becoming..Sue blushed and climbed into her bed.XYFNKWWhen the light was out and she was alone, Sue lay awake and stared at the ceiling..Why do I need a nurse anyway?XYFNKWI've grown far beyond the age I need a nurse.XYFNKWStill grumbling she drifted off to sleep..The next morning did not begin well.XYFNKWFirst, Sue was late for breakfast.XYFNKWHer mother glared as Sue hurriedly slid into her seat and sent the juice glasses to slopping over onto the white tablecloth..Oh, I am sorry, I slept late.XYFNKWSue mopped at the juice with her napkin..My dear, you are a princess, the Queen said, you must be punctual.XYFNKWIf you cannot be on time, don't make excuses, and certainly don't rush about out of breath...After breakfast the princesses gathered to work on their needle point.XYFNKWSue stabbed herself, and bled so badly that she ruined three months of painstaking work.XYFNKWHer finger bandaged, she was sent outside to amuse herself until lunch, with the order to stay out of the mud, and her sisters' demure titters ringing in her ears...What use is it to be a princess if I can't be a happy princess?XYFNKWGradually the warm sun began to cheer her up.XYFNKWThen she heard the wonderful voice from the night singing.XYFNKWFollowing the voice until she reached the pond Sue saw a large green frog sitting on a stump.XYFNKWShe squealed and jumped back.XYFNKWThe frog jumped into the pond.XYFNKWThe ball which the princess dropped, rolled into the pond...How am I going to get my ball back without getting covered with mud?XYFNKWthe princess wailed.XYFNKWOh, why can't I do anything right?...Albert looked carefully out from under the water.XYFNKWThe girl sat on the grass crying bitterly.XYFNKWHe had often seen the princesses playing near his pond and felt sorry for the youngest princess.XYFNKWHe liked her best because she was the only one who ever seemed to appreciate his pond.XYFNKWOn an impulse, he dived down into the water and with a great effort pushed the ball to the surface and rolled it to the princess.XYFNKWSue looked at him in astonishment...Thank you, oh, thank you.XYFNKWShe grabbed the ball and laughed.XYFNKWThey will never believe this in the castle.XYFNKWAlbert was so pleased with himself that he swelled up with song.XYFNKWSue's eyes bulged and she almost dropped her ball again..It was you singing last night, she gasped in astonishment.XYFNKWYou must be a prince under enchantment.XYFNKWNo frog could sing so beautifully.XYFNKWThe princess looked around.XYFNKWI will take you home and break your enchantment.XYFNKWThen we can be friends.XYFNKWShe quickly caught Albert and ran home to hide him in her room..Albert was devastated.XYFNKWThis place was cold and hard, and worst of all it was dry.XYFNKWThere not a decent bit of water or mud to be found.XYFNKWHe missed the sun and the familiar murk of his pond.XYFNKWAs the day turned into evening his loneliness became so great that he began to sing..It was a terribly mournful song, and as Sue came into her room and heard it, it caught at her heart..It must be terrible to be a prince, and have to live as a frog.XYFNKWShe picked Albert up and hugged him.XYFNKWAlbert was so sad that he kept singing his unhappy song.XYFNKWFrog, Sue said between her sobs, you are so unhappy.XYFNKWI wish I could make you a prince.XYFNKWAnd she kissed him..Who is that man?XYFNKWthe King thundered from the doorway.XYFNKWSue didn't answer, for she was staring at Albert in amazement.XYFNKWAlbert had turned from a frog into a man..Why are you in my daughter's bedroom?XYFNKWthe King roared at Albert, but Albert didn't answer either he was looking at himself in amazement..Why frog, you are a prince, Sue squeaked..Hardly a prince if he appears like that in a princess's bedroom, the King bellowed, since, being a frog, Albert had no clothes...The King and Queen were up all night discussing what they were going to do.XYFNKWThey finally decided that the only way to avoid a scandal was for Albert and Sue to get married, immediately, so they planned the wedding for the next week...Albert found the change to palace life very difficult.XYFNKWHe wasn't sure how to eat with knife and fork.XYFNKWClothes were strange and uncomfortable.XYFNKWBut most of all he missed being a frog and singing in his beloved pond all day.XYFNKWThe only thing that made it at all bearable was the princess.XYFNKWShe taught him how to eat with utensils and helped him choose the most comfortable clothes.XYFNKWShe even stood up for him when he chose his entire wardrobe in green.XYFNKWBut each evening Albert would slip out of the castle and go down to the pond.XYFNKWThere he would sit in the light of the moon and sing.XYFNKWThey were sad songs, and Sue listening on her balcony would determine to try even harder to make her prince happy..One day while Albert and Sue sat in the sunny courtyard escaping from the wedding plans for a brief time, Sue's nurse came out to bustle Sue back into the castle...I'm about to be married.XYFNKWI don't need a nurse, Sue yelled in rebellion.XYFNKWGo away, and don't bother me anymore.XYFNKWThe old woman looked at Sue then slowly and silently left...Why did you yell at her so?XYFNKWAlbert asked.XYFNKWSurely she is only trying to help..She's been my nurse longer than I can remember.XYFNKWBut I don't need a nurse anymore, and I don't like being fussed over..If you don't need a nurse, maybe she needs you.XYFNKWSue looked at him quizzically..Why should she need me?XYFNKWI'd think that she would be glad to do something else for a change..What?XYFNKWAlbert asked reasonably.XYFNKWShe has always been Nurse..I don't know.XYFNKWThat's her problem anyway, Sue grumped..You are her princess.XYFNKWI think that makes it your problem, Albert pointed out.XYFNKWYou should give her something else to do if you want her to stop bothering you..Sue looked at him for a moment...I hadn't thought of that.XYFNKWShe jumped up.XYFNKWI'm going to go and talk to her...What are you going to ask her to do?XYFNKWasked the frog prince..To be the nurse for our children!XYFNKWSue laughed, and ran off to find Nurse.XYFNKWAlbert sighed and wandered down to the pond.XYFNKWHe thought wistfully of his old uncomplicated life as a frog..Yet as the days before the wedding shortened, Albert's common sense made itself felt.XYFNKWEven the King found himself discussing difficult problems with his guest.XYFNKWThe Queen went so far as to admit one night while she and the King worked over the proclamation for the wedding that Albert might make quite a suitable match..By the way dear, have you found out exactly who Albert is?XYFNKWshe asked.XYFNKWWe really can't have a proclamation reading 'Today the Princess Susan Aurelia Constance Esther marries Albert.' We need to know a little more about his background..Quite right, you should ask Sue in the morning...The next morning, the day before the wedding, Sue walked down the stairs to breakfast...Good morning.XYFNKWShe smiled, and glided into her place..Good morning Sue.XYFNKWThe Queen nodded.XYFNKWYour father found a minor detail that needs to be cleared up.XYFNKWWe need to know Albert's full name and a little more about him for the proclamation..I have been so busy that I never thought to ask him.XYFNKWSue said.XYFNKWI will ask him today..Out in the courtyard, which had become their favourite place, Sue found Albert.XYFNKWHe was staring moodily through the gate down toward his old pond..Albert, my mother asked me what your other names are..Other names?XYFNKWI only have one name..But Princes always have lots of names.XYFNKWLike me, I have four..I like Sue best, Albert said with a smile..But you are a Prince, you must have other names...No, Albert sighed I have no other names.XYFNKWI am not a Prince.XYFNKWSusan stared at him, then laughed...You must be a Prince.XYFNKWWhy would anyone enchant somebody who wasn't a Prince?You did, Sue, Albert said looking at her with an expression she couldn't quite fathom..Oh Albert.XYFNKWSue blushed..But you did Sue.XYFNKWYou turned me into a Prince..And if I turned you into a Prince, what were you before?XYFNKWShe demanded..A frog.XYFNKWI'm a frog, Sue.XYFNKWI was never a prince until I met you..You're not an enchanted Prince?XYFNKWSue's face turned red.XYFNKWYou let me think you were a Prince all this time, and all the time you were just a frog?XYFNKWWhat am I going to tell my father?XYFNKWThat I'm marrying a frog?XYFNKWSue stood now, screeching at him..Albert flinched with each question..You creature.XYFNKWYou abominable creature.XYFNKWI hate you.XYFNKWThe princess turned and fled from the courtyard...Albert sat for a long while, then slowly he stood and walked down to the pond, a sad, shrinking figure in green.....The Princess locked herself in her bedroom.XYFNKWShe refused to talk to anyone.XYFNKWOther than to tell her father through the door that the wedding was off that everything had been a terrible mistake.XYFNKWShe closed the window then wept on her bed for three days..Finally, she got up and washed her face.XYFNKWSquaring her shoulders, she unlocked the door and went down to breakfast.XYFNKWHer family greeted her with a wary silence.XYFNKWThe Queen gave her an approving nod..Things returned almost to normal.XYFNKWAs the weeks passed, Sue floated quietly through life, her face cold and pale.XYFNKWShe rapidly lost weight.XYFNKWOne morning she no longer had the strength to get up...The King and Queen worried about her.XYFNKWThey begged their daughter to tell them what was making her so unhappy.XYFNKWBut Sue simply stared out the window and said nothing.XYFNKWThe old nurse came to the princess's room to be by her side.XYFNKWShe bustled about cleaning and tidying, opening the window to let the fresh summer air in.XYFNKWThe day passed and as the evening came Sue heard a voice singing outside her window.XYFNKWIt sang of the summer night, and the sorrow of a love lost.XYFNKWIt sang of the moon shining on the pond and of a beautiful princess named Sue.XYFNKWIt sang of enchantment and a broken heart...Albert, the princess whispered.XYFNKWShe stood and staggered to the window.XYFNKWAlbert...His deep, sad voice soared through the night, telling of the joy and sorrow of his love...Sue sat on the balcony and listened to the song through the night.XYFNKWIn the grey of the early morning she slipped out of the castle.XYFNKWWalking slowly but with iron determination she made her way down to the pond..Albert, she called into the silver mists.XYFNKWAlbert, I'm sorry.XYFNKWI love you.XYFNKWThe effort of walking overcame the weakened princess and she fainted beside the pond.XYFNKWThere Albert, once again a frog, found her...My poor Sue, Albert said as he kissed her.XYFNKWI wish I could make you happy...The rising sun shone gold on two happy frogs as, hand in hand, they hopped into the pond....Jacks..Queen Gillian sat at the oak table in her council chamber and played at jacks while her advisors argued amongst themselves.XYFNKWShe was young to be Queen - not yet a decade, but her father had died in the same plague that had devastated the male population of her kingdom..I say that we muster our troops and meet them at the border.XYFNKWWe will push them into the river or die trying..We don't have enough men to hold the border.XYFNKWWe must pull back and prepare the castle for a siege..Jill finished her eightsies and put the jacks and the ball away..We have lost enough men to the plague, the young Queen said.XYFNKWWe will not throw any more lives away.XYFNKWThis is what we will do.....Prince Johan rode at the head of his army of unwanted extra sons from his land...General, send a reminder down the line.XYFNKWThere will be no looting or molesting the people.XYFNKWIf we plan to live here we must not make enemies of my future subjects.XYFNKWThe older man nodded and signalled his staff.XYFNKWThe Prince led his army across the river..They rode without resistance through a countryside rich with fields ready for harvest.XYFNKWThey arrived at the city gates to find them wide open and a Marshall on a white horse waiting for them.XYFNKWHe carried a white flag on a standard..My Queen would meet with you and your General, he said.XYFNKWThe rest of your men are welcome to make camp on the pasture..Give the orders, Johan said..They followed the Marshall through a city with far too few men.XYFNKWThe people's eyes followed the invaders with an expression the Prince couldn't name - somewhere between despair and hope..Queen Gillian met them in her council room...Prince Johan bowed deeply to the young girl in front of him.XYFNKWShe was dressed in the simplest of frocks, and only a gold wire holding back her hair hinted at royalty...As I am sure you are aware Prince Johan, my kingdom has suffered deeply.XYFNKWWe need the men that you have brought with you to rebuild.XYFNKWThe question then is who will rule this Kingdom?XYFNKWthe Queen walked over to the Prince and looked him long and hard in the eyes.XYFNKWMy people would not be content to be ruled by a foreign prince..You don't have the means to stop me from taking the throne..No, I don't, the Queen admitted.XYFNKWBut if I were to just give you the throne, what authority would you have to order your new Kingdom?XYFNKWI won't let you just walk in and take my Kingdom..Prince Johan sighed.XYFNKWI was hoping to avoid bloodshed...Nothing comes without a price.XYFNKWShe upended a leather bag on the table and steel jacks clattered onto the oak.XYFNKWThe ends of the jacks had been filed to sharp points.XYFNKWPlay me a game of jacks for my Kingdom.XYFNKWLet the only blood to be shed be yours and mine.XYFNKWIf you win, the Kingdom is yours.XYFNKWIf I win you will serve the Kingdom as I see fit...You would decide the fate of your kingdom with a child's game?I'm a child..I used to be a fair hand at jacks, Johan said with a shrug..We each will get three tries.XYFNKWBut first you must swear on the breath in your lungs and the salt in your veins.XYFNKWSwear on your mother's life and your father's grave, that you will abide by the outcome of the game..Johan swore and the Queen did as well.XYFNKWShe pushed the jacks and the ball to him..You start..He tossed the ball in the air and picked up a jack.XYFNKWHe breezed through the early rounds as his hands remembered the rhythm.XYFNKWHalfway through fours a sharpened jack stabbed deep into his finger.XYFNKWHe gasped and missed the catch...The Queen tossed the jacks and began playing.XYFNKWShe made it to fives before a jack stuck in her hand.XYFNKWShe caught the ball and pulled the jack out.XYFNKWShe made it to sevens before missing a jack.XYFNKWShe pushed the bloodied jacks to Johan...He tossed them out and started at fours.XYFNKWThis time he made it to sevens before missing the catch.XYFNKWThe Queen almost immediately sent an errant jack spinning across the table.XYFNKWJohan started again, his hand was bleeding from tiny wounds and he had a hard time catching the now slippery ball, but he made it to nines before missing..The Queen took her lip in her teeth.XYFNKWHer smaller hands were in worse shape than Johan's but she made it through nines to tens.XYFNKWJohan caught the ball on the next toss..You have won, my Queen..The Queen took his hand in hers and led him into the throne room.XYFNKWA smaller chair sat beside the throne.XYFNKWShe sat Johan in the chair..You and I will rule this land together.XYFNKWShe kissed him on the cheek before seating herself and whispered to him.XYFNKWI won't always be a child, my Prince..What have I got myself into?XYFNKWJohan watched his General kneel to pledge allegiance to Queen Gillian....Anything for Gold..Sascha limped into the bar and took a table where she could sit with her back to a wall facing the door.XYFNKWA young girl came and deposited a mug of beer on the table.XYFNKWSascha used a scrap of sleeve wetted with beer to clean the blood from her face.XYFNKWThe girl appeared again and left a cleaner cloth.XYFNKWSascha smiled thanks and went back to her ablutions.XYFNKWShe drank what was left of the beer and settled in for a long wait..A polished steel shield hung on the wall.XYFNKWFrom what she could see of the bartender in it he looked more troll than human.XYFNKWSascha wondered what he thought of her.XYFNKWShe knew even with her best efforts, blood caked in her eyebrows and hair, turning fiery-red dark.XYFNKWFortunately, none of the cuts and tears in her clothes were in places which could cause trouble...Well after moonrise, Jacko slid into the seat across from her.XYFNKWThe room had filled up and they could talk under the boisterous crowd...What happened to you?A couple of bravos thought they needed my purse more than I did..Jacko winced, Did you have to let them bleed all over you?One thought he could hold me while his partner finished me.XYFNKWI had to cut his throat.XYFNKWShe shrugged.XYFNKWIt was messy..They must have been desperate..I wouldn't know..After all that you didn't even check their purses?Whatever else I might be I am not a thief..You could have taken enough for some new clothes..Sascha stared at him until Jacko looked down..OK, OK, you'll do anything for gold but steal it.XYFNKWI don't get you, Sasch..You don't need to get me.XYFNKWShe leaned forward across the stained wood of the table.XYFNKWDid you get the information I asked you about?I did, the old man's holed up in the old monastery outside the south wall..Thanks She dropped a handful of coins on the table.XYFNKWBuy yourself a decent meal..Her stained and ragged clothing helped Sascha blend into the shadows well enough the guards didn't notice her climb over the south wall.XYFNKWThe moon shone bright enough to reveal handholds, but not so bright as to make her stand out.XYFNKWShe reached the bottom and stretched out the cramps in her hands..The place was more ruin than monastery.XYFNKWWalls and roofs now jumbles of stone.XYFNKWThe only building still standing was the crypt for the monks who never left their retreat even in death.XYFNKWShe pushed on the door and found it barred from the inside.XYFNKWShe smiled, neither corpses or ghosts had any reason to bar the door.XYFNKWWith the blade of her thinnest knife she lifted the bar and eased the door open...The faint gleam of moonlight didn't show anything but dust and bones.XYFNKWShe entered the crypt and followed the faint scent of cheese.XYFNKWAn old man waited for her...Robson sent you..He wants the stone..Ah, the old man nodded.XYFNKWWant some cheese?Sascha shrugged and took the chunk of cheese from his hand.XYFNKWShe bit into it and almost cried at its sharp flavour against her tongue..There is water if you wish to clean up.XYFNKWHe tossed her a bundle of cloth.XYFNKWMy fellows won't mind if you borrow a robe.XYFNKWThe smell of death disturbs me..You're afraid of dying?XYFNKWSascha asked through the splashes of water on her face..No..I was hoping you would be..So I would just give you the stone?I don't want to kill you..But you will if you have to..I will do what I need for Gold..The old man looked at her sadly..I don't see greed in your eyes..Nonetheless..He reached into his robe and pulled out a tiny bundle wrapped in silk..Silk is the only substance that the stone won't affect.XYFNKWBe careful.XYFNKWHe handed it to her..Sascha allowed the silk to move from the stone and touched it against a bone that lay on the floor.XYFNKWIt turned into pure yellow gold..Why?You are at the very edge of darkness.XYFNKWI didn't want to push you over..Then you understand..Goodbye Sascha, you're almost free..Without Gold, I will never be free..Remember the silk.XYFNKWThe crypt went dark...Sascha found herself outside the crypt.XYFNKWShe shook her head and patted the small weight of the stone in her pocket.....Robson was waiting for her in the room he called his throne room..You have it?Gold first...He snapped his fingers and one of the thugs beside him pulled a little girl from behind Robson her hair the colour fine gold...Mommy!XYFNKWthe girl cried..Hi Gold..Robson took the little girl's hand and kept her from running to her mother..The stone first..This is the last time, Sascha said holding up the tiny bundle..Sascha, Sascha, you can trust me.XYFNKWLet me see the stone, then we'll talk.XYFNKWHe let go of Gold and the girl ran to her mother..Sascha tossed the stone to Robson and swept up Gold in her arms.XYFNKWShe used the bit of silk to wipe the tears from her daughter's eyes....Honour..Sir Cathvart reined in his horse at the bridge.XYFNKWHe held up his mailed fist to signal the rest of his troop to stop.XYFNKWStanding on the bridge was a man in rusty armour, but holding a well-kept sword..Out of my way.XYFNKWI am on a mission for the King..You may not pass..Come now, the knight dismounted and walked toward the man on the bridge, We are both honour bound to obey the King's desires..Honour is a lie..Honour is everything.XYFNKWIt is our honour as knights that makes us who we are..The other man remained silent.XYFNKWSir Cathvart could see that he was an older man, but there were remains of heraldic colours on his armour..We will have a test of arms.XYFNKWIf you prevail, then my men will turn away and not bother you anymore.XYFNKWYou hear?XYFNKWhe called, If this good knight wins the day, then you are to pass by without molesting him.XYFNKWThere.XYFNKWThey will obey as men of honour..The older man's answer was to lunge, quick as a snake.XYFNKWThe point of his sword scraped across the paint of Cathvart's chest plate.XYFNKWCathvart threw himself backwards but he rolled to his feet with sword in hand..The rusty knight might have been older, but he was no slower or frailer than Sir Cathvart himself.XYFNKWAfter his first precipitate lunge, he followed up with several double handed blows that would have cleaved in a helm even if Cathvart were wearing one.XYFNKWThe younger knight was able to push the blows to one side, but he wasn't able to set himself solidly..He was forced back onto the road where his men had to scramble to get their horses out of the way.XYFNKWFinally, the old knight over extended just slightly, but Cathvart stepped aside and pushed him off balance.XYFNKWThe knight stumbled to one knee.XYFNKWCathvart stepped back and waited for the older man to right himself..You fight well..For an old man..I mean you fight well.XYFNKWYou should come to the tourney.XYFNKWYou would do well in the lists..I don't fight for fun.XYFNKWThe older man began his attack again, but this time Cathvart was ready for him.XYFNKWBlows that would have split his armour open were pushed to the side.XYFNKWHe saw an opening and tried an attack of his own.XYFNKWThe rusty armour turned his blade and he leapt back to be ready for the next onslaught.XYFNKWThe older man surprised him by chuckling and switching to a more subtle fencing style..Now his sword came at him in feints and lunges that were much harder to parry than the graceless pounding that had started the fight.XYFNKWCathvart found himself giving ground again..You are a strong fighter, Cathvart gasped.XYFNKWJoin our quest..And what is it this time?XYFNKWThe horns from a golden cow?XYFNKWThe hair of a mermaid?.You mock us, Cathvart managed to lock their swords for a brief moment.XYFNKWThe King is bringing peace to all the land.XYFNKWHe will rule through his knights.XYFNKWThey will rule with honour...The older knight pushed him away and came very close to taking Cathvart's head..I told you, the old man said.XYFNKWHonour is a lie..The two knights circled on the road.XYFNKWWhile the older knight had a seemingly endless repertoire of attacks and feints, the younger knight was stronger and well trained.XYFNKWThe mounted troop watched and occasionally hissed or cheered.XYFNKWOn the other side of the bridge some peasants had heard the sound of battle and come to peer through the bushes to watch...Both men were gasping for air now and their blows more often wide of their target.XYFNKWThere was no more conversation.XYFNKWA strap on Sir Cathvart's right greave broke and the plate protecting his leg dangled lose.XYFNKWAs he stepped back to adjust it he realized that the other man was going to strike at his vulnerable leg.XYFNKWIt wasn't so much a plan as instinct which put his sword where it would catch the old knight's arm as he struck...The blade sliced through the leather arm-guard and the rusty-armoured knight's sword fell to the dust..Well fought, but now you must let us pass, Cathvart let exhaustion pull his sword point down..The old man swept up his sword with his left hand and ran through Cathvart's unprotected leg..I told you, the old man snarled, I don't fight for fun.XYFNKWHe tried to pull the sword out and finish the younger knight, but the steel was jammed in the powerful muscle of the thigh.XYFNKWThat second of hesitation was enough for Cathvart's sword to find the man's throat..Cathvart looked at the man he had killed..He was a strange man, but he died with honour..What should we do with them?XYFNKWhis lieutenant asked, pointing at the peasants..They are on the King's land.XYFNKWKill them all..Cathvart sat while his surgeon bandaged his leg.XYFNKWHe wished he could join his troop in clearing the King's land.XYFNKWThere was no honour in killing peasants, but it was practice of a sort.XYFNKWInstead he had to sit here and just listen to the screams....Learning Honour..I was once where you are watching the words go up into the blue like so many soap bubbles.XYFNKWYou feel no care, no urgency, but be warned!XYFNKWIn the right hands even soap bubble might be dangerous..You say the words are floating to no purpose, your attention is fleeting, and there is a limit to how many words I have to tell my story?Sadly, you are right, the days of the garrulous old narrator are past, so we start..One of the times that I was young, yes, I mean exactly that, I have been young many times young as a flower, young as a tree, even young as a rock.XYFNKWThis time I was young as the youngest son of a rice farmer...Look if you are going to keep interrupting, we will never get started.XYFNKWWatch the words, count them if you must and we will see where they take us...As I said, I was the son of a rice farmer.XYFNKWHe had mud between his toes and mud between his ears.XYFNKWI, according to him and every other person in the village, had nothing but air between my ears.XYFNKWEveryone in the village would be breaking their backs planting rice seedlings while I listened to stories from a wandering monk..I cared not for what any of them thought.XYFNKWThere was a bigger world than my muddy little village and I was going to explore it..No, it wasn't fair, but I was young and my head was full of stories and air.XYFNKWI didn't care.XYFNKWInevitably, I ended up leaving as soon as I thought I could take care of myself.XYFNKWWith the surprising gift of a bag of rice and a bowl to cook it in, I set out on the faint track that brought wanderers in, and very quickly after, took them away again...The track went from muddy to earthy and the sparse trees to bamboo.XYFNKWIt is hard to describe the exact shade of green that sunlight shining through bamboo creates, or the smell.XYFNKWI had never experienced either so it isn't surprising that I was paying so little attention to what I was doing that I tripped over a body lying beneath the bamboo...At least I thought it was a body, I'd seen enough in my young life, but none with so many bandages seeping red life through them.XYFNKWThe body moved with what I thought was miraculous speed and a knife was at my throat.XYFNKWI was too excited to be afraid.XYFNKWHere was something new, my only fear was that I would die before I took in more of this glorious experience..Yet the knife did not cut my throat it retreated and the man sighed..Why should you die for my weakness?XYFNKWhe said, Just be sure to bury me with all my armour..Why would I bury you?XYFNKWI set to making a fire to cook my rice.XYFNKWI had heard stories of healing from the wandering monks and so, I was sure that I was a healer.XYFNKWI found moss and herbs and after sharing my rice with the man, I made a poultice and put it on his wounds and make a tea for him to drink..It is a wonder I didn't kill him, a second wonder he began to recover.XYFNKWThe third wonder is he took me as his apprentice..What did this man look like?XYFNKWI see him through two sets of eyes, the awe of youth and the weariness of the old.XYFNKWHe was tall and strong, yet ancient (he must have been all of thirty) his armour was fearsome (it was cut and broken and mismatched)..I carried all his gear and walked behind.XYFNKWI tried to imitate the swagger of his walk.XYFNKWHe made little sound and soon, I made less.XYFNKWWhen he went through his patterns with his sword, I tried to imitate him with a switch of bamboo.XYFNKWHe laughed and corrected me, and soon he was teaching me everything he knew about the art of mayhem...We meandered toward civilization while Hiro taught me to slice through bamboo as if I slicing through necks.XYFNKWIt was a great game.XYFNKWWe left the bamboo and walked through scrubby forest.XYFNKWWe walked through a village and I ignored the fearful looks as Hiro did.XYFNKWIn the third village, we passed one of the elders prostrated himself before Hiro...There are bandits troubling us, sir, he said visibly trembling.XYFNKWWould you consider dealing with them for us?Does it look like my honour is for sale?XYFNKWHiro said and kept walking..Oh no, sir, the elder shook even more as he tried to grovel and keep up with us at the same time.XYFNKWBut someone of your obvious honour might agree to help some poor villagers against those with none..Hiro stopped and looked at the old man.XYFNKWHe put his hand on his sword and appeared to be deep in thought..Very well, he finally said, I need nothing, but my man here needs food and proper clothing.XYFNKWThe old man nodded and scuttled away.XYFNKWI puffed out my chest at being described as a man.XYFNKWWe waited for a while before the old man returned with some clothes that looked like they would fit and a pot filled with rice and even a bit of meat..Hiro waved at me and I quickly changed into the new clothes.XYFNKWI thought they were grand, (they were thread bare dress clothes that were much too big for me.) Once the old man retreated Hiro helped himself to much of the rice and stew from the pot.XYFNKWEven after we both ate our fill, there was some left over..We must look around, Hiro said, Watch and learn.XYFNKWHe led me around the edge of the village and pointed out tracks where villagers went in and out of the brush.XYFNKWHe stopped at one trail.XYFNKWLook, these were made by someone wearing boots.XYFNKWHe pointed to his own boots.XYFNKWI looked at my feet and saw immediately what he meant.XYFNKWI nodded..We concealed ourselves and I played out battle scenarios in my head.XYFNKWI always came out the victor.XYFNKWSometimes I slaughtered the entire evil band, and sometimes I was merciful and sent them off to become monks.XYFNKWI was so occupied with my inner battle that I completely missed the arrival of the bandits...Hiro didn't.XYFNKWHe rose on his silent feet and quietly killed the last bandit in the line of seven.XYFNKWThen the next, and the next.XYFNKWThe fourth one didn't die quietly and his gurgling cry alerted the remaining three.XYFNKWThey whirled and drew in one swift motion.XYFNKWSpreading out they attacked, first one, then another.XYFNKWHiro was spinning and his sword whistled through the air.XYFNKWHe was so busy defending that he didn't have time to attack...I took a sword from one of the corpses and lunged at the back of one of Hiro's opponents.XYFNKWThe man spun and blocked my swing with ease.XYFNKWHe laughed and left Hiro to his two companions.XYFNKWHe whirled his sword through the air and flicked cuts in my new clothes.XYFNKWSoon they were bloody rags.XYFNKWI heard a grunt of pain and hoped it wasn't Hiro, but I was too busy to look..My opponent drove me back into the brush.XYFNKWHe didn't say anything, but he was chuckling the whole time.XYFNKWI was no more an opponent for him than the bamboo was for me.XYFNKWThis was a game for him, and death for me..A root saved me.XYFNKWI tripped on it and fell to the ground.XYFNKWThe bandit's sword missed its swing and caught for an instant in a branch...I screamed and lunged again.XYFNKWInstead of trying to cut, I held the sword like the boar spear some of the men in the village used to kill pigs for meat.XYFNKWBecause his sword tangled for that second, his parry was just a hair late.XYFNKWMy sword sliced deep and cut the big artery in his thigh.XYFNKWHot blood sprayed into my face and the bandit fell back with a scream...I furiously scraped at the blood on my face trying to clear my sight.XYFNKWThere was no sound of battle.XYFNKWHad Hiro won?XYFNKWHad the bandits?XYFNKWI had to see!It's OK, boy, Hiro's voice cut through my panic.XYFNKWHe gave me a rag to clean my face..When I was steadier I looked at the corpse of the bandit.XYFNKWIf he could die then I could die too.XYFNKWMy mortality settled around my shoulders like a cloak.Clean your sword, then we will see if there is anything else worth taking..It isn't honourable to steal from the dead..Honour tastes good on the tongue, but it won't fill your belly, Hiro looked at me until I nodded and went over to the corpse to see what I could find...Now if I had more time I would tell you how I almost became the best swordsman in the land, I might even tell you about the witch, but the sun is low on the horizon and I must be off....Cindy's Fella..Cindy dug the shovel into the large pile of manure left behind by Cleopatra.XYFNKWThe strong odour of the manure surrounded her and she breathed it in.XYFNKWHer sisters, step-sisters actually, could hardly stand to enter the barn, never mind help to clean it.XYFNKWCindy loved the barn.XYFNKWIt was her refuge from the annoyances of life in the manor house.XYFNKWShe dumped the shovel load into the wheelbarrow and dug in for another load.XYFNKWIt was truly astonishing how much one rather elderly cow could produce, both milk and manure.XYFNKWTo Cindy's mind they were of equal importance.XYFNKWThe milk paid for the day to day expenses of the manor while the manure went to fertilize the garden patch that would feed them through the winter...It took several trips to bring Cleopatra's contribution to the garden and properly dig it in around the vegetables, especially the large pumpkin.XYFNKWShe was hoping to enter it in the fair.XYFNKWCindy could have made just the one trip, but her step-mother didn't think it proper for her to sling the wheelbarrow around like a common farm hand.XYFNKWBesides it took longer this way...Yet no matter how much she dawdled over the work, the work got done and she had to put away the tools and go back up to the house..Cindy, Anatolia looked up from where she lounged on the couch.XYFNKWWhen's supper?XYFNKWI am famished...I will start it immediately, Cindy said...Cindy, Zetta wrinkled her nose, You stink, I will simply not eat anything you cook before you wash..But I'll die if I don't eat soon.XYFNKWAnatolia rubbed her generous stomach..I doubt that very much, the girls' mother said, Cindy, go wash.XYFNKWYou must learn to be more careful.XYFNKWA lady doesn't reek of the barn...Cindy guessed she wasn't much of a lady then, since she usually reeked of the barn.XYFNKWShe knew better than to say anything.XYFNKWHer step-mother wasn't too lady-like to wield a rod to chastise Cindy.XYFNKWNot that Cindy liked stinking to high heaven, but she saw it as an inescapable result of her efforts to feed the family...Her family, such as it was, was otherwise completely incapable of caring for themselves.XYFNKWHer father had been a successful and comfortable farmer.XYFNKWWhen he died, his second wife and her daughters discovered that it took a great deal of work to be successful farmers.XYFNKWWork that they were completely unwilling to put in.XYFNKWThe farm was sold off piece meal until only the large 'manor' house and barn remained with just enough land to plant a garden..She would have liked to have soaked properly, but the threat of Anatolia's complaints drove her out the water.XYFNKWShe dried off quickly and put her cooking dress on.XYFNKWIt was an older mode with tighter sleeves unlikely to catch fire from the old stove..Cindy didn't like the kitchen as much as the barn.XYFNKWShe didn't mind cooking but there were constant interruptions...Is there something I can eat while I wait?XYFNKWAnatolia asked as she shuffled through the narrow door.XYFNKWAnother year and she wouldn't fit...There are some peeled carrots on the table, Cindy pounded on the tough meat to tenderize it enough to meet her step-mother's exacting standards..I don't want carrots, Anatolia whined, Don't you have any sweets?No, Cindy said, You know your mother has banned sweets..And with good reason, Zetta walked in a sniffed to check on Cindy's level of cleanliness, if you get any bigger you won't fit your dresses and Mother doesn't want to take them out again..Anatolia picked up a carrot and heaved a great sigh.XYFNKWShe sidled back out of the kitchen..Make sure you cut all the fat off my meat, Zetta said.XYFNKWYou missed some last night.XYFNKWShe followed her sister out of the kitchen...Cindy had no idea what they did with themselves through the day.XYFNKWThey never seemed to be very far apart.XYFNKWHer step-mother spent her days plotting how to restore the fallen fortunes of the farm without actually going so far as to do any work.XYFNKWCindy was content with the way things were.XYFNKWShe couldn't manage a large farm by herself.XYFNKWRight now, she was just able to keep the balance between being busy and being able to finish her work...She supposed some people would be upset by the demands of her step-family.XYFNKWBut Cindy would be doing all the work anyway.XYFNKWAfter changing her dress for dinner and eating with the others she did the dishes.XYFNKWThe last thing she did every night was milk Cleopatra..It was dim in the barn and the old cow mooed a welcome to Cindy.XYFNKWShe set the stool beside the cow and set the bucket in place.XYFNKWCindy marveled that this last remaining cow continued to give milk in generous amounts.XYFNKWWhen the milking was done, she put the milk in the cool urn, then spent some time brushing Cleopatra.XYFNKWShe put down fresh straw for the cow and fill the manger with hay and the trough with clean water...Cindy took one last breath of the barn air redolent with smell of everything she loved, then closed the doors and went off to bed.....She woke to the sound of the birds singing outside her window..Dratted birds, she mumbled as she put on her barn clothes and went out to milk Cleopatra.XYFNKWShe patted the old cow and went through the chores.XYFNKWAfter breakfast her step-mother sent her into town to buy a couple of things..I have work to do, Cindy said..If I send Zetta, she will complain bitterly, her step-mother said, then come back with all the wrong things to punish me.XYFNKWAnatolia would just spend the money on sweets.XYFNKWGet on with you.XYFNKWShe put the few coins into Cindy's hand.XYFNKWYou will take far too long with all your talking to people, but I know you will buy what I tell you..So instead of working in the garden, Cindy put on her nice dress and walked into town.XYFNKWShe didn't mind much.XYFNKWShe hadn't seen her friends in a while..Morning, John, she said to the dairyman, Mother wants a cheese.XYFNKWYou can deliver it to the house later..Certainly, Cindy, John said, I'll be going by that way later..She wandered through town picking up the few things on the list from the merchants.XYFNKWShe greeted each one by name and they treated her well though she was only spending a few pennies.XYFNKWIn the centre of town there was a crowd gathered by a poster.XYFNKWThose who could read were standing near the poster and announcing its contents to everyone else..Hey Cindy, Bill called, You going to the ball?Do I look like I'm going to a ball?XYFNKWCindy said, I doubt the Prince even knows I exists..Says here that all eligible maids are to attend the ball..Well then, Cindy looked at herself, I don't look much like a maid..The crowd laughed and Cindy waved and headed off home...The exchange unsettled her.XYFNKWShe enjoyed the farming, but was it what she wanted for the rest of her life?XYFNKWShe imagined herself married to one of Bill's older brothers.XYFNKWThey had a whole herd of milk cows and chickens too.XYFNKWShe would be doing chores from dawn to dusk.XYFNKWShe didn't mind the work, but there would be nothing else.XYFNKWBill's mother's eulogy last year was summed up in five words.XYFNKWShe was a hard worker.XYFNKWCindy found herself imagining what she would wear to the ball.....The prince stalked through the halls of the palace hoping that some servant would be foolish enough to get in his way maybe that pert new servant girl from his mother's wing of the palace.XYFNKWImagining her heart-shaped face cowed with fear made him smile.XYFNKWHe shook his head angrily.XYFNKWNo smiles.XYFNKWThe prince was a person to be feared today.XYFNKWNo one feared someone prancing about with a silly grin on their face..Reluctantly he pushed the thought of the girl out of his head and reflected on the recent conversation with his father, the King..So Father, the prince had said, now that I'm twenty-one, are you going to make me your heir?Humph, The King glowered at him and tapped his fingers on the arms of his chair.XYFNKWYou're too wild right now.XYFNKWYou need to settle down and start producing heirs..You make me sound like some bull at one of those tiresome fairs..The King looked the prince over and grunted, his fingers struck the wood like hammers..Those bulls have value, he said finally, all you do is cause trouble.XYFNKWI wanted to find you a nice princess, but you've scared them all away with your antics.XYFNKWSo, you will have to find someone from around here..The only women around her are farmers and servants!You don't seem to find servants unattractive, the King said, In fact your constant attraction to them is costing the kingdom a fortune.XYFNKWAt least a farmer would be able to explain the finer points of a prize bull..The prince swelled up to unleash his rage, but his father raised his hand...If you won't choose a wife, then I will choose one for you.XYFNKWBe sure that I will have the future needs of the kingdom in mind.XYFNKWThe prince imagined the bride his father would select for him, some sturdy woman with a strong constitution and no grace.XYFNKWHe shuddered...I am throwing a ball, the King put his hand down and ran it across the arm of his chair, for all the maids in the kingdom.XYFNKWYou will choose one to be your wife.XYFNKWWhen your heir is apparent, I will consider making you my formal heir...The prince left the room very carefully not slamming the door.XYFNKWThe King was not someone to be trifled with.XYFNKWAs soon as he rounded the corner out of King's quarters he let his boots slam into the stone floor and twisted his face into a scowl.XYFNKWHe was no prize bull to be set out to stud!XYFNKWThough to be honest, he had collected quite a herd.XYFNKWHe leaned against the wall and went through their faces in his mind.....Cindy made it back home and took the small bag of purchases into the house.XYFNKWShe discovered her step-mother running her hands over two bolts of fine cloth..What did you sell this time?XYFNKWCindy asked.XYFNKWI know we didn't have the money for that..Don't be impertinent, her step-mother's eyes took on the glare which preceded a beating.XYFNKWSomeone must look out for the welfare of this family..Cindy went looking through the house trying to think of what was missing that would have paid for that cloth..Well, at least she won't always smell of the barn, she heard Zetta say..But I'll miss the fresh cream, Anatolia said..Cleopatra!XYFNKWCindy ran out to the barn.XYFNKWSure enough, the old cow's stall was empty.XYFNKWShe stormed back into the house and interrupted her step-mother measuring the cloth against her step-sisters..How could you?XYFNKWCindy said, Cleopatra's milk was the only thing keeping us from starving..With a daughter married to the prince, I won't have to worry about starving..Every girl in the kingdom will be at that ball!Which is why I had to buy the fabric I need to give my daughters an edge..You could at least have bought colours that would suit them, Cindy said and ran up to her room..She refused to come out to cook or clean.XYFNKWHer step-mother gave up on her and even went as far as to wedge the door closed with a chair.XYFNKWAnatolia came and begged her to cook.XYFNKWZetta came to sneer and complain.XYFNKWCindy ignored them all.XYFNKWShe pulled out an old dress of her mother's that had hung in the back of her closet for as long as she could remember.XYFNKWIt used to smell of her mother, now it just smelled musty..Cindy aired the dress out and tried it on.XYFNKWIt was loose in some places and tight in others, yet fit surprisingly well.XYFNKWShe spent some time altering it as best she could while she tried not to hear the steady tramp of feet in and out of the house.XYFNKWThey would never be able to pay for all this fuss.XYFNKWHer step-mother was going to put them out on the street.XYFNKWThere wasn't much left to sell..The day of the ball came and Cindy carefully rolled the dress up and fit it into a pillow case.XYFNKWShe held the case as she climbed down the trellis outside her window.XYFNKWThe only place she could think to change was the barn.XYFNKWShe put on the dress and tried her best to tidy herself..Well it's good to see that you can make yourself presentable, her step-mother said as she walked into the barn, but there's no need for you to go to the ball.XYFNKWYou have a fiance already..What are you talking about?Farmer Jones needs a new wife.XYFNKWHe's had his eye on this farm for a while.XYFNKWSince you like farming so much, it is a perfect match.XYFNKWHe doesn't care about this ball since he only has sons..Farmer Jones is old enough to be my father!XYFNKWI won't marry him..You may not like me, but I am your mother and you will do what I say..I won't, Cindy tried to run past her step-mother, but the older woman was faster and stronger than the she expected.XYFNKWShe caught Cindy's arm in an iron grip and pulled her close...You will do what I say, girl, or some sad accident will befall you.XYFNKWI did it before I can do it again.XYFNKWShe pushed Cindy back into the barn and slammed the door closed.XYFNKWThe bar outside dropped with a bang.XYFNKWAll the other doors would be barred too and there was no trellis to climb down...She felt like she was going to burst.XYFNKWShe kicked and pounded on the door, but though it was old it was still all too solid.XYFNKWThe sound of horses pulling a carriage came through the door and she collapsed into tears.XYFNKWThis really was it.XYFNKWThere was no escape from her future life as Bill's step- mother.XYFNKWShe was younger than he was!XYFNKWIf it had been someone else, it might have been funny..The barn was very silent without Cleopatra in it.XYFNKWCindy sighed and leaned against the door.XYFNKWIt was going to be a long night..She wasn't sure how long she had sat, huddled against the door before she noticed a strange light coming from Cleopatra's stall.XYFNKWCindy got up to investigate.XYFNKWShe walked to the stall and peeked around the door.XYFNKWBusily cleaning the stall with a tiny broom was a woman who didn't stand as tall as Cindy's waist..Well come in, dear, the woman said.XYFNKWIt isn't polite to stare..Cindy reluctantly walked into the stall.XYFNKWSomehow as she entered it, the cramped space grew larger and she found herself eyeball to eyeball with the strange woman..Don't fret about it, the woman said, it will just give you wrinkles.XYFNKWShe waved her hand and a ball of light floated up above them.XYFNKWNow, let me get a good look at you.XYFNKWShe made spinning motions with her fingers and Cindy slowly turned around..I know that dress has sentimental value, but it just won't do.XYFNKWShe waved her hand again and the sudden weight of a beautiful gown draped from Cindy's shoulders.XYFNKWShe struggled to breathe..Small breaths, dear, a corset takes some getting used to, but you'll be fine..She made the spinning motion with her hand again and Cindy turned again..Better, better.XYFNKWShe waved her hand and Cindy's hair crawled and tugged until she thought it would pull right out..Finally, it stopped and she lifted her hand to feel..Ah, ah, the woman said, don't fuss.XYFNKWShe led the way out into the barnyard.XYFNKWThe moon was just rising and gave the place a magical glow.XYFNKWThe woman walked over to the garden and peered at the pumpkin..This will do fine..But that's going to be my prize pumpkin..Listen, Cindy, I promised your mother to look after you, not to rescue you from your own stupidity.XYFNKWYou can either go to the ball and marry the prince or you can stay here, grow prize pumpkins and marry Farmer Jones..Cindy shuddered and turned away from the garden.XYFNKWThe woman waved her hand once more and the pumpkin exploded into a fine coach.XYFNKWTwo unwary rabbits became horses to draw the coach, another became a driver..Here are the rules, child, the woman was taller than Cindy now, you have until midnight to capture the prince no later, not one second after midnight.XYFNKWAt the fading of the last stroke of midnight the spell will end.XYFNKWDon't worry about leaving early I've given you a little advantage.XYFNKWThe poor boy won't be able to resist you.XYFNKWJust leave before the last stroke of midnight and you become the next princess.XYFNKWStay any later and I won't be responsible for what happens.XYFNKWShe smiled brightly.XYFNKWBut I know you will follow the rules.XYFNKWNow get your pretty glass slippers into the carriage and go..Cindy climbed into the pumpkin carriage and the rabbit horses dashed away.XYFNKWShe pulled up to the palace much sooner than she expected.XYFNKWMore magic probably.XYFNKWShe wondered briefly about how her mother might have met such a strange person, but she didn't have time to dwell on it.XYFNKWThe guards helped her out of the carriage and sent it off..I'm supposed to leave at midnight, she said..That's your driver's problem, the guard said and pointed into the palace...Cindy walked through the hallways in a daze.XYFNKWTorches lit the way and highlight gold framed portraits and marble sculptures.XYFNKWHer glass slippers clinked faintly on the stone.XYFNKWWhat would it be like to live here?XYFNKWShe finally arrived at the doors to the ballroom.XYFNKWBill stood by the door pulling at the neck of his uniform.XYFNKWHis eyes widened when he saw Cindy...You look good..And that's a surprise?No I mean you always look nice, but now you look like a princess..All the better to catch a prince..I'm not sure he's that much of a catch, Bill whispered.XYFNKWMost of the girls here are terrified of him..So what are you doing here?My father is getting married again, probably to some widow who will do nothing but complain about how the place is run.XYFNKWMy brothers are farmers, but I want something different.XYFNKWThis is the first step..So some glowing lady came and offered you the chance to change your life?What are you talking about?.Nothing, never mind, Cindy took a deep breath.XYFNKWYou'd better open those doors and let me in.XYFNKWBy the way, I'm supposed to leave at midnight.XYFNKWLet me know when it gets close...Sure thing, Cindy, Bill threw the doors open and Cindy walked into the ballroom..The room looked like something out of a fairy tale.XYFNKWThe walls were draped with fine cloth, a long table groaned beneath the weight of more food than Cindy's farm grew in a year.XYFNKWMusicians on a balcony played a sprightly tune.XYFNKWThough the floor had been polished to a mirror-like shine, the glass slippers gripped it comfortably.XYFNKWIn this setting magic was easy to believe in..Then she noticed the reek of desperation.XYFNKWThe huge room was filled with young women who wore grim faces and glared at each other, while they shot fear filled glances at the prince.XYFNKWHe had dressed in white and was surrounded by other men in shades of grey and black.XYFNKWThey danced with young women while the prince lounged on the throne that had been set at the far end.XYFNKWHe was making no attempt to hide his boredom and contempt...It was shocking how ugly a beautiful room could be made by the presence of the wrong person.XYFNKWThe women who should have been laughing and enjoying themselves were dressed more by their fear or avarice than their fine clothes.XYFNKWThe men wore their lust like finery.XYFNKWShe shuddered.XYFNKWCindy was almost ready to turn around and take her chances with Farmer Jones, when her eyes met those of the prince.....The prince was inescapably bored.XYFNKWThe women hovered around him.XYFNKWThey giggled nervously or tried to act like they weren't just farmer's daughters overdressed for the night.XYFNKWThere were two girls who wore hideous dresses, one was stuffing her face at the buffet while the other scowled at everyone who approached her.XYFNKWAnother girl curtsied in front of him and he twirled his fingers, she stared at him..Turn around, he said, and rolled his eyes.XYFNKWShe gulped and attempted a pirouette, slipped and fell to her knees, then ran off weeping.XYFNKWThe door at the far end opened to let in some cow who couldn't tell time.XYFNKWHe glanced up to see what new torture was to be visited upon him and his eyes met hers..If you had put a sword to his throat he couldn't have told you the colour of her dress, but her eyes were the incredible blue of those flowers his horse ate on the side of the rode.XYFNKWHe would never let his horse eat them again..Without thinking about it he got up from his seat and went to greet this vision of loveliness..Somehow his greeting turned into the first steps of a dance.XYFNKWThe orchestra sat up straight and started playing the music for his dance.XYFNKWThere was a collective sigh and the other girls started eyeing up his attendants in grey for possible dancing ability.XYFNKWWhatever dance he began she followed, she laughed at his jokes and not just a nervous titter either.XYFNKWHe filled her plate with food and her cup with wine.XYFNKWAs the evening progressed he paid less and less attention to the other people who inhabited the room...One of his guards started making odd gestures at them.XYFNKWHe glared at the man, someone who had just joined up that day, he'd have him flogged and cast out, but only after he had finished with this most enchanting woman.XYFNKWHe led her out to the patio where they were out of view of the crowd...The music was quieter here, but he was content to just hum along.XYFNKWNo conversation was necessary with those extraordinary eyes on his.XYFNKWHe heard the clock begin to strike midnight, time to end this farce of a ball.XYFNKWHe would marry this woman and they would rule the kingdom as soon as the old man had the decency to die...For some reason, she was trying to pull away from him, but he was used to dealing with reluctant women and he just tightened his grip.XYFNKWThe last stroke of midnight was fading when she shrugged and blinked.....The whole evening had been very strange, as if riding to a ball in an oversized pumpkin wasn't strange enough.XYFNKWFrom the moment, their eyes met the prince hadn't left her side.XYFNKWCindy had watched as desperation faded to resignation and the other girls started looking for matches not quite as lofty as a prince..He insisted on feeding her and plying her with wine.XYFNKWIt was probably the wine that made her forget about the time.XYFNKWShe was feeling quite tipsy by the time he pulled out onto the patio.XYFNKWAt least there was a pleasant breeze blowing out here.XYFNKWThe prince was humming along to the music with a fatuous grin on his face..The clock was striking twelve.XYFNKWShe had to leave..Unfortunately, the prince was considerably stronger than her, and very determined that she not leave.XYFNKWAs the clock hit the final stroke she gave up and shrugged.XYFNKWHe would have to see what he was getting sooner or later..The dress faded away as the sound of the clock vanished.XYFNKWShe felt her hair tumble down to its usual tangle about her shoulders..What is that smell?XYFNKWthe prince asked..That would be the barn, Cindy said, I was locked in it before all this started..Oh great, said the prince, I suppose it would have been too much trouble to take a bath?My step-mother locked me in the barn..Of course she did, the prince rolled his eyes.XYFNKWWell at least let me get a decent look at you.XYFNKWTurn around.XYFNKWHe waved his hand at her..You've been doing nothing but stare at me all night..But now I want to look at you..Just her and the prince out here.XYFNKWThe pleasant breeze of a moment ago turned chill and raised goosebumps on her arms.XYFNKWShe crossed her arms to warm herself..Blast you, stupid cow!XYFNKWthe prince shouted, I will see what you have.XYFNKWHe grabbed her dress and wrenched at it.XYFNKWCindy heard the fabric of her mother's dress tear and the chill wind blew across her breasts.XYFNKWHe grabbed at her and twisted her flesh...Cindy didn't know whether to curse herself or her mother's friend.XYFNKWShe settled on kneeing the prince between the legs.XYFNKWHe stopped fumbling with his pants and went a little cross-eyed...Guards!XYFNKWhe screamed.XYFNKWGuards, arrest this woman!XYFNKWHis fists clenched and he looked like he wasn't going to wait for the guards before doing more damage.XYFNKWCindy sighed and gave him a proper kick.XYFNKWHis eyes rolled up into his head and he fell to the ground.XYFNKWShe gathered the remnants of her dress about her and looked for an escape..Too late.XYFNKWA guard approached her and stepped into the light surrounding her and the prince..I tried to warn you about the time, Bill said, If I'd known what a dastard he was I would have dragged you off myself..So now I guess you have to arrest me.XYFNKWCindy held her hands in front of her.XYFNKWThe wind caressed her skin.XYFNKWBill's eyes widened and he whipped off his vest and wrapped it around her..Come with me, he said his voice breaking.XYFNKWHe put his arm around her and pulled her into the darkness as other guards came running past.XYFNKWNone of them paid them any attention...Did you think the night would end like this?XYFNKWCindy said, You throwing me into the dungeons?.Don't know where the dungeons are, Bill said as a familiar smell filled her nose.XYFNKWI rode Blackie here when I came to work.XYFNKWI expect he'll be glad to carry me away again.XYFNKWHe held her gently by the shoulders.XYFNKWI'm no prince.XYFNKWI'm just the youngest son of an old farmer..Youngest sons are supposed to be lucky.XYFNKWCindy put her finger on his lips.XYFNKWAnd right now I've had my fill of princes.XYFNKWShe helped him get Blackie out of his stall.XYFNKWBill lifted her up, then jumped up behind her.XYFNKWCindy could hear shouts approaching..I think it's time to go.XYFNKWI hear it's a long ride to the next kingdom..Bill kicked Blackie into a gallop and they rode out the gates.XYFNKWCindy laughed and kicked the slippers off her feet..The tinkling sound of breaking glass followed them as they rode away into the night....The End of Snow White..Snoring filled the cottage.XYFNKWEven with her hands tight against her ears Snow White couldn't block out the cacophony of wheezes and snorts.XYFNKWChubby was worst not because he was loudest, but because he would stop breathing for a while and, counting the seconds, she would wait until he grunted and started breathing once more..Snow White didn't know how her grandmother had managed with seven.XYFNKWMaybe they hadn't snored.XYFNKWMaybe pigs had flown too.XYFNKWThe only thing that had changed about the little men was their names.XYFNKWSnow White got up and went downstairs to clean.XYFNKWShe might be called Snow White after her grandmother and but she didn't feel much like Snow White, more like Dingy Grey...The truth was the little men were slobs.XYFNKWShe used a stick to pick up the laundry.XYFNKWThey insisted on throwing down their clothes where ever they happened to be standing when the notion took them to change from one horrifically dirty outfit to another.XYFNKWThe sight of naked little men stomping through the cottage was seared into Snow White's mind.XYFNKWNothing she said would change their behaviour.XYFNKWAs they pointed out each time she complained, it was their cottage...Hey Snow, a raspy voice floated down the stairs, You want some help getting to sleep?You forget, Sleazy, Snow White said without turning around, I've seen what you've got, and it doesn't give a girl any confidence.XYFNKWThere's a good reason people call you 'little men'..With a harrumph and banging of boots whichever little man it was returned to his bed.XYFNKWNone of them were really called Sleazy, but it was the name she used whenever one of them made advances.XYFNKWShe had learned not to turn around.XYFNKWShe could never keep from laughing and it made them even more cantankerous than usual..The last bit of clothing went into the huge pot she used for laundry and with a bit of soap it would do until morning.XYFNKWSnow White put on a cloak and went out into the night to breathe.XYFNKWShe walked away from the cottage so none of the little men could see her.XYFNKWShe was tired of their eyes always following her.XYFNKWIt was cold, but the air was fresh.XYFNKWShe amused herself by catching some of the snow that fell from the trees and comparing it with her skin.XYFNKWDefinitely more grey than white..It's dangerous for a young girl to be out in the night like this.XYFNKWSnow White shrugged and turned to where the huntsman was stepping out of the shadows..It's dangerous to be me, she said, it doesn't matter the place or time..Someone might come upon you and ravish you..Right, Snow White flipped him a hand sign that her dear departed father would have told her no self-respecting princess should know never mind employ.XYFNKWSorry, Pops, she thought, I've got no respect left, for myself or anyone else..The huntsman frowned and gripped her shoulder..I have the power of life and death over you, Princess, he said..Sure, Snow White said, You could go running to your Queen and tell her that you accidentally didn't really kill me, and sort of accidentally brought her a deer heart instead..The huntsman growled and gripped her tighter, he put a hand on the collar of her dress and Snow White stopped him..Don't you dare rip my dress.XYFNKWShe pushed him away, This is the last bit of comfortable clothing I have left..But The huntsman pouted..Oh, alright, Snow White said, and let her dress fall to the snow, Just pretend my cloak is my dress.XYFNKWBut can we please at least go somewhere dry?XYFNKWThere's a cave this way.XYFNKWShe picked up the dress and led the Huntsman deeper into the woods..In the morning Snow White watched the little men stagger off toward the mine that gave them just enough iron ore to eke out a living.XYFNKWAdding her full-sized appetite to the mix really stretched their resources.XYFNKWThat was why she pretended that she didn't know that they doubled back to watch her take her bath and wash her clothes.XYFNKWFor people who made so much noise the rest of the time, they were remarkably quiet..As punishment for the come-on the night before, Snow White cut short her washing and wrapped up in a towel that felt like burlap.XYFNKWShe boiled some water and tossed in some mint for flavour.XYFNKWShe sat in the kitchen and waited for her clothes to dry enough to get dressed.XYFNKWIt was a once a week ritual that no one talked about.XYFNKWOne of these days they would make the connection between the midnight propositions and the length of her bath.XYFNKWShe snorted, probably not.XYFNKWLittle they were, but they were still men...Snow White sipped her mint tea and considered her life.XYFNKWThe huntsman was mildly amusing, but his obsession with her was going to cause trouble.XYFNKWIt was the same with all of them.XYFNKWThey all thought that they were beyond the sight of the Queen.XYFNKWThe end was always the same.XYFNKWAt least her father had just thrown them in the dungeons.XYFNKWThe Queen apparently was infuriated by the ease with which Snow White ensnared the boys and men around her.XYFNKWThe men in Snow White's life tended to die.XYFNKWIt was depressing...The Queen wanted Snow White dead, and Snow White didn't blame her.XYFNKWBut she wasn't going to lie down and die for anyone.XYFNKWShe wasn't enjoying her life much, but she wasn't ready to give it up just yet..Are you sure you'll be alright?XYFNKWChubby looked up at Snow White.XYFNKWI'll stay here and take care of you while the others go to town...Sure, said Handy, and we all know what you'll be about while we're gone.XYFNKWHe glowered at the other four little men.XYFNKWWe all go.XYFNKWShe'll be just fine.XYFNKWHe looked up at her through his eyebrows.XYFNKWSnow White nodded and that was that.XYFNKWThe little men clambered up on the wagon, and their one wretched mule pulled them away down the trail away from the cottage.XYFNKWSnow White watched long enough to be sure that they were gone.XYFNKWShe could count on their jealously to keep them all together to town and back...Snow White heated the water and luxuriated in the first long, private bath in months.XYFNKWShe almost wished the huntsman would come by..Snow White washed all the linens and scrubbed what she could of the cottage.XYFNKWShe hated cleaning, but she hated dirt worse.XYFNKWThe days passed and she found herself missing the company.XYFNKWThey were pigs and perverts and whatever else, but they surrounded her with life.XYFNKWSnow White wasn't very good company for herself..The huntsman never showed and when the little men came home she learned why..The Queen had him tied to a stake and then choked him with his own organ..How could she choke him with his heart?XYFNKWshe said..It wasn't his heart, Handy said, It was a different organ..Right, Snow White said, so what did you buy for food?.The usual, Chubby said.XYFNKWSnow White rolled her eyes.XYFNKWIf we bought anything different the Queen would suspect something...Why would she care about a few grubby miners?She cared about the huntsman sure enough, Pinky said..Snow White shrugged..You don't seem too upset that a man who saved your life is dead.XYFNKWHandy said..Every man in my life ends up dead, Snow White said, It's like a curse.XYFNKWShe laughed as the little men all backed away from her.XYFNKWDinner isn't going to cook itself.XYFNKWShe walked into the cottage.XYFNKWI'll call you when it's ready, she said over her shoulder..The little men kept their distance for a day or two, but habit and inclination were too strong and soon they were ogling her again and strutting naked through the cottage.XYFNKWTheir raspy voices called from the top of the stairs at night.XYFNKWSnow White went from feeling dingy grey to feeling very dark indeed...Their snores still kept her awake but something was different tonight.XYFNKWThe sound didn't have its full richness.XYFNKWA small man climbed into her bed and grabbed at her flesh...Don't pretend you don't like it, the little man said, You went off quick enough with your precious huntsman.XYFNKWSnow White made a noise of disgust and pushed the little man away.XYFNKWShe pulled her legs up to her chest.XYFNKWSo now you go all shy and virtuous, the man sneered and tried to push her legs aside.XYFNKWSnow White kicked out and launched the little man out of the bed.XYFNKWHe bounced across the floor and down the stairs..The snores of the other little men didn't change.XYFNKWSnow White didn't feel like going and dealing with whoever was at the bottom of the stairs.XYFNKWWith any luck, he would just go back to bed and try to forget his humiliation..When the men got up in the morning, they found Handy lying at the bottom of the stairs with his neck broken.XYFNKWThey looked at him, then Snow White who stood at the top of the stairs..Well, damn, Chubby said, How are we going to survive with just four of us running the mine?XYFNKWThey all turned and looked at Snow White..No, she said, no way.XYFNKWI'm no miner..You're going to earn your keep one way or another, Chubby said.XYFNKWYou choose..If I bang my head, she said, I'm going to burn your supper..Pinky went up the stairs and fetched Handy's work bag.XYFNKWHe handed her the dead man's helmet and pick axe.XYFNKWThe four little men picked up their comrade and slung him on the wagon.XYFNKWSnow White followed them to the mine..They tossed the body into a dead-end tunnel and piled some rocks to block it.XYFNKWOne of them spat on the rocks then they led Snow White deeper into the mine.XYFNKWShe saw a glint in the rock from one of their lamps.XYFNKWShe turned her own lamp on the rock..Is this gold?XYFNKWshe said..Yup, Chubby said, Leave it alone..Why?.What would happen if someone learned we had gold up here?XYFNKWThey'd come and kill us and take our mine, that's what would happen.XYFNKWGold is trouble.XYFNKWStick to the iron ore...Snow White shook her head, but the little men didn't look so ridiculous with their hammers and axes.XYFNKWThey led her deep into the mountain.XYFNKWShe banged her head several times and muttered curses that bounced off the little men.XYFNKWThey were in their element now.XYFNKWThe cottage was only where they lived.XYFNKWThe mine was where they were alive..She hated it.XYFNKWEven with the helmet her head ached.XYFNKWSoon, her shoulders and back ached too.XYFNKWThe little men cracked the rock with hard, rhythmic strokes.XYFNKWSnow White's hands vibrated from hitting the rock and she barely scratched the surface..OK, Chubby said after an eternity, go and make us supper..The walk back to the cottage was long and excruciating.XYFNKWIt was worse than the night that she had followed the huntsman into the woods knowing that she would have to seduce him to save her life.XYFNKWShe couldn't face the idea of seducing the little men.XYFNKWThe very idea made her ill...Even the snoring didn't keep her awake that night or for the rest of the week.XYFNKWShe slept exhausted until morning.XYFNKWThe men glared at each other jealously.XYFNKWSnow White knew it was only a matter of time before they came up with a solution that would make them happy and complete her fall from being Snow White...It didn't take as long as she had hoped..I got the short straw, Pinky said and leered at her..Short straw, said Snow White, how appropriate.XYFNKWHis leer slipped a little, but only a little.XYFNKWThe work day passed as slowly as all the others.XYFNKWSnow White walked back to the cottage as quickly as she could.XYFNKWShe could pack up and move on.XYFNKWShe didn't know where, but she would find a place..The berries were lit by a beam of golden sunlight.XYFNKWThe huntsman had pointed them out once..Eat one of those and you'll never wake up, he'd said...Snow White looked at them.XYFNKWHere was her solution.XYFNKWShe thought of sleeping and never waking up.XYFNKWAfter picking every berry there she hurried back to the cottage.XYFNKWShe crushed the berries and added them to the rough stew that was all they ate.XYFNKWIt smelled as vile as it always did.XYFNKWHer cooking was only marginally better than the little men's...The little men arrived home.XYFNKWThey came to the table with their filthy hands and filthier grins.XYFNKWThey were all looking forward to this night.XYFNKWThe stew vanished from their plates and Snow White dished out seconds.XYFNKWFinally, Pinky sighed and let out a huge belch..Well boys, he said, I'm for bed.XYFNKWHe winked at them and leered at Snow White.XYFNKWDon't keep me waiting..I'll just clean up some, Snow White said..Don't keep me waiting, Pinky said again and let his hand rest on her shoulder possessively.XYFNKWSnow White nodded..She heard them stomping around upstairs.XYFNKWShe took as long as she could clearing up...Get up here, girl, the raspy voice of a little man came down the stairs.XYFNKWSnow White took a deep breath and slowly climbed the stairs.XYFNKWThe four men were staring at her...Well, Pinky said as he stood naked and eager, it's time.XYFNKWThen he fell flat on his face and started snoring.XYFNKWThe others fell back on their beds and began snoring too..Snow White stood there and listened to the snores.XYFNKWShe listened until one by one the snores stopped..In the morning, she took the wagon and the old mule.XYFNKWShe left the bodies in the beds.XYFNKWIt took her all day to load the loose gold at the mine into the wagon..Let's go, she said to the mule.XYFNKWOne last trip and you can retire.XYFNKWShe drove the mule away from the mine and the cottage and the last of the Kingdom that knew her as Princess Snow White...She looked at her arms that were black with rock dust, maybe someday she would feel clean again...The Beginning..In late afternoon, in the autumn of 1989, I'm at my desk, looking at a blinking cursor on the computer screen before me, and the telephone rings..On the other end of the wire is a former Iowan1 named Michael Johnson.XYFNKWHe lives in Florida now.XYFNKWA friend from Iowa has sent him one of my books.XYFNKWMichael Johnson has read it his sister, Carolyn, has read it and they have a story in which they think I might be interested.XYFNKWHe is careful, refusing to say anything about the story, except that he and Carolyn are willing to travel to Iowa to talk with me about it..So I agree to meet with them in Des Moines the following week.XYFNKWAt a Holiday Inn near the airport, the introductions are made, and the two of them sit across from me, evening coming down outside, light snow falling..They insist on a promise: If I decide not to write the story, I must agree never to mention what happened in Madison County, Iowa, in 1965 or other events that followed over the next twenty-four years.XYFNKWAll right, that's reasonable.XYFNKWAfter all, it's their story, not mine...So I listen.XYFNKWI listen hard, and I ask hard questions.XYFNKWAnd they talk.XYFNKWOn and on they talk.XYFNKWCarolyn cries openly at times, Michael struggles not to.XYFNKWThey show me documents and magazine clippings and a set of journals written by their mother, Francesca...Room service comes and goes.XYFNKWExtra coffee is ordered.XYFNKWAs they talk, I begin to see the images.XYFNKWFirst, you must have the images, then come the words.XYFNKWAnd I begin to hear the words, begin to see them on pages of writing.XYFNKWSometime just after midnight, I agree to write the story - or at least attempt it..Their decision to make this information public was a difficult one for them.XYFNKWThe circumstances are delicate, involving their mother and touching upon their father.XYFNKWMichael and Carolyn recognized that the story going public might result in dirty gossip and affect good memories people have of Richard and Francesca Johnson..Yet in a world where personal commitment in all of its forms seems to be destroyed and love has become a matter of convenience, they both felt this remarkable tale was worth the telling.XYFNKWI believed then, and I believe even more strongly now, they were correct making this decision..In the course of my research and writing, I asked to meet with Michael and Carolyn three more times.XYFNKWOn each occasion, and without complaint, they traveled to Iowa.XYFNKWSuch was their eagerness to make sure the story was told accurately.XYFNKWSometimes we merely talked sometimes we slowly drove the roads of Madison County while they pointed out places having a significant role in the story...In addition to the help provided by Michael and Carolyn, the story as I tell it here is based on information contained in the journals of Francesca Johnson research carried out in Madison County, Iowa information obtained from the photographic essays of Robert Kincaid and long discussions with several wonderful elderly people in Ohio, who remembered Kincaid from his boyhood days...In spite of the effort, gaps remain.XYFNKWI have added a little of my own imagination in some instances, but only when I felt I had gained the intimate familiarity with Francesca Johnson and Robert Kincaid through my research.XYFNKWI am confident that I have come very close to what actually happened..One major gap involves the exact details of a trip made across the northern United States by Kincaid.XYFNKWWe knew he made this journey, based on a number of photographs published, a brief mention of it by Francesca Johnson in her journals, and handwritten notes he left with a magazine editor.XYFNKWUsing these sources as my guide, I retraced what I believe was the path he took from Bellingham to Madison County in August of 1965.XYFNKWDriving toward Madison County at the end of my travels, I felt I had, in many ways, become Robert Kincaid..Still, trying to truly understand Kincaid was the most challenging part of my research and writing.XYFNKWHe is an elusive figure.XYFNKWAt times, he seems rather ordinary.XYFNKWAt other times ethereal.XYFNKWIn his work, he was a consummate professional.XYFNKWYet he saw himself as a peculiar kind of male animal becoming obsolete in a world given over to increasing amounts of organization...Two other intriguing questions are still unanswered.XYFNKWFirst, we have been unable to know what became of Kincaid's photographic files.XYFNKWGiven the nature of his work, there must have been thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of photographs.XYFNKWThese never have been found.XYFNKWOur best guess - and this would be logical to the way he saw himself and his place in the world - is that he destroyed them before his death...The second question deals with his life from 1975 to 1982.XYFNKWVery little information is available.XYFNKWWe know he earned a sparse living as a portrait photographer in Seattle for several years and continued to photograph the Puget Sound area.XYFNKWOther than that, we have nothing..Preparing and writing this book has altered my world view, transformed the way I think, and, most of all, reduced my level of cynicism about what is possible in the arena of human relationships.XYFNKWComing to know Francesca Johnson and Robert Kincaid, I find the boundaries of such relationships can be extended farther than I previously thought.XYFNKWPerhaps you will have the same experience in reading this story..That will not be easy.XYFNKWIn an increasingly callous world, I'm not sure where great passion leaves off and mawkishness begins.XYFNKWBut our tendency to laugh at the possibility of deep feelings makes it difficult to enter the realm of gentleness to understand the story of Francesca Johnson and Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWI know I had to overcome that tendency initially before I could begin writing..If, however, you manage to suspend your disbelief, as Coleridge put it, I am confident you will experience what I have experienced.XYFNKWAnd deep in your heart, you may even find, as Francesca Johnson did, room to dance again...Summer 1991...Robert Kincaid..On the morning of August 8, 1965, Robert Kincaid locked the door to his small two-room apartment on the third floor of a house in Bellingham, Washington.XYFNKWHe carried a knapsack full of photography equipment and a suitcase down wooden stairs and through a hallway to the back, where his old Chevrolet pickup truck was parked in a space reserved for residents of the building..Another knapsack, a medium-size ice chest, two tripods, cartons of Camel cigarettes, a Thermos, and a bag of fruit were already inside.XYFNKWIn the truck box was a guitar case.XYFNKWKincaid arranged the knapsacks on the seat and put the cooler and tripods on the floor.XYFNKWHe climbed into the truck box, stepped in behind the wheel, lit a Camel, and went through his mental checklist: two hundred rolls of film tripods cooler three cameras and five lenses jeans and khaki slacks shirts.XYFNKWOkay.XYFNKWAnything else he could buy on the road if he had forgotten it...Kincaid wore faded Levi's, well-used field boots, a khaki shirt, and orange suspenders.XYFNKWOn his wide leather belt was fastened a Swiss Army knife in its own case...He looked at his watch: eight-seventeen.XYFNKWThe truck started on the second try, and he backed out, shifted gears, and moved slowly down the alley under hazy sun.XYFNKWThrough the streets of Bellingham he went, heading south on Washington 112, running along the coast of Puget Sound for a few miles, then following the highway before meeting U.S.XYFNKWRoute 20..Turning into the sun, he began the long, winding drive through the Cascades.XYFNKWHe liked this country and felt impressed, stopping now and then to make notes about interesting possibilities for future expeditions or to shoot what he called memory snapshots.XYFNKWThe purpose of these photographs was to remind him of places he might want to visit again and approach more seriously..He wished for the thousandth time in his life that he had a dog, a golden retriever, maybe, for travels like this and to keep him company at home.XYFNKWBut he was frequently away, overseas much of the time, and it would not be fair to the animal.XYFNKWStill, he thought about it anyway.XYFNKWIn a few years, he would be getting too old for the hard fieldwork.XYFNKWI might get a dog then, he said to the coniferous green rolling by his truck window...Drives like this always put him into a taking-stock mood.XYFNKWThe dog was part of it.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid was as alone as it's possible to be - an only child, parents both dead, distant relatives who had lost track of him and he of them, no close friends...He knew the names of the man who owned the corner market in Bellingham and the proprietor of the photographic store where he bought his supplies.XYFNKWHe also had formal, professional relationships with several magazine editors.XYFNKWOther than that, he knew scarcely anyone well, nor they him.XYFNKWGypsies make difficult friends for ordinary people, and he was something of a gypsy..He thought about Marian.XYFNKWShe had left him nine years ago after five years of marriage.XYFNKWHe was fifty-two now that would make her just under forty.XYFNKWMarian had dreams of becoming a musician, a folksinger.XYFNKWShe knew all of the Weavers' songs and sang them pretty well in the coffeehouses of Seattle.XYFNKWWhen he was home in the old days, he drove her to gigs and sat in the audience while she sang..His long absences - two or three months sometimes - were hard on the marriage.XYFNKWHe knew that.XYFNKWShe was aware of what he did when they decided to get married, and each of them had a vague sense that it could all be handled somehow.XYFNKWIt couldn't.XYFNKWWhen he came home from photographing a story in Iceland, she was gone.XYFNKWThe note read: Robert, it didn't work out.XYFNKWI left you the Harmony guitar.XYFNKWStay in touch..He didn't stay in touch.XYFNKWNeither did she.XYFNKWHe signed the divorce papers when they arrived a year later and caught a plane for Australia the next day.XYFNKWShe had asked for nothing except her freedom...At Montana, he stopped for the night, late.XYFNKWThe Cozy Inn looked inexpensive, and was.XYFNKWHe carried his gear into a room containing two table lamps, one of which had a burned-out bulb.XYFNKWLying in bed, he was reading The Green Hills of Africa' and drinking a beer.XYFNKWIn the morning, he jogged for forty minutes, did fifty push-ups, and used his cameras as small hand weights to complete the routine...Across the top of Montana, he drove, into North Dakota and the spare, flat country he found as fascinating as the mountains or the sea.XYFNKWThere was a kind of austere beauty to this place, and he stopped several times, set up a tripod, and shot some black-and-whites of old farm buildings.XYFNKWThis landscape appealed to his minimalist leanings.XYFNKWThe Indian reservations were depressing, for all of the reasons everybody knows and ignores.XYFNKWThose kinds of settlements were no better in northwestern Washington, though, or anywhere else, he had seen them..On the morning of August 14, he sliced northeast and took a back road up to Hibbing and the iron mines.XYFNKWRed dust floated in the air, and there were big machines and trains specially designed to carry the ore to Lake Superior.XYFNKWHe spent an afternoon looking around Hibbing and found it not to his liking, even if Bob Dylan was from there originally...The only song of Dylan's he had ever really cared for was Girl from the North Country.XYFNKWHe could play and sing that one and he hummed the words to himself as he left behind the place with giant red holes in the earth.XYFNKWMarian had shown him some chords and how to handle basic arpeggios to accompany himself.XYFNKWShe left me with more than I left her, he said once to a boozy riverboat pilot.XYFNKWAnd it was true...The Superior National Forest was nice, real nice.XYFNKWVoyageur country.XYFNKWWhen he was young, he'd wished the old voyageur days were not over so he could become one.XYFNKWHe drove by meadows, saw three moose, a red fox, and lots of deer.XYFNKWAt a pond, he stopped and shot some reflections on the water made by an odd-shaped tree branch.XYFNKWWhen he finished he sat on the board of his truck, drinking coffee, smoking a Camel, and listening to the wind in the birch trees..It would be good to have someone, a woman, he thought, watching the smoke from his cigarette blow out over the pond.XYFNKWGetting older puts you in that frame of mind.XYFNKWBut with him gone so much, it would be tough on the one left at home.XYFNKWHe'd already learned that..When he was home in Bellingham, he occasionally dated the creative director for a Seattle advertising agency.XYFNKWHe had met her while doing a corporate job.XYFNKWShe was forty-two, bright, and a nice person, but he didn't love her, would never love her...Sometimes they both got a little lonely, though, and would spend an evening together, going to a movie, having a few beers, and making pretty decent love later on.XYFNKWShe'd been around - two marriages, worked as a waitress in several bars while attending college.XYFNKWEvery time, after they'd completed their lovemaking and were lying together, she'd tell him, You're the best, Robert, no competition, nobody even close...He supposed that was a good thing for a man to hear, but he was not all that experienced and had no way of knowing whether or not she was telling the truth anyway.XYFNKWBut she did say something one time that haunted him: Robert, there's a creature inside of you that I'm not good enough to bring out, not strong enough to reach'.XYFNKWI sometimes have the feeling you've been here a long time, more than one lifetime, and that you've lived in private places none of the rest of us has even dreamed about.XYFNKWYou frighten me, even though you're gentle with me..He knew in an obscure way what she was talking about.XYFNKWBut he couldn't get his hands on it himself.XYFNKWHe'd had these kinds of thoughts, a sense of the tragic combined with intense physical and intellectual power, even as a young boy growing up in a small Ohio town.XYFNKWWhen other kids were singing Row, Row, Row Your Boat, he was learning the melody and English words to a French cabaret song..He liked words and images.XYFNKWBlue was one of his favorite words.XYFNKWHe liked the feeling it made on his lips and tongue when he said it.XYFNKWWords have physical feeling, not just meaning, he remembered thinking when he was young.XYFNKWHe liked other words, such as distant, wood-smoke, highway, ancient, passage, voyageur, and India for how they sounded, how they tasted, and what they conjured up in his mind.XYFNKWHe kept lists of words he liked posted in his room..Then he joined the words into phrases and posted those as well:..Too close to the fire..I came from the East with a small band of travelers..The constant chirping of those who would save me and those who would sell me..Talisman, Talisman, show me your secrets.XYFNKWHelmsman, Helmsman, turn me for home..Lying naked where blue whales swim..Before I became a man, I was an arrow - long time ago...Then there were the places whose names he liked: the Somali Current, the Big Hatchet Mountains, the Malacca Strait, and a long list of others.XYFNKWThe sheets of paper with words and phrases and places eventually covered the walls of his room..Even his mother noticed something different about him.XYFNKWHe never spoke a word until he was three, then began talking in complete sentences, and he could read extremely well by five.XYFNKWIn school, he was an indifferent student, frustrating the teachers...They looked at his IQ scores and talked to him about achievement, about doing what he was capable of doing, that he could become anything he wanted to become.XYFNKWOne of his high school teachers wrote the following in an evaluation of him: He believes that 'IQ tests are a poor way to judge people's abilities'.XYFNKWI suggest a conference with his parents.XYFNKWHis mother met with several teachers.XYFNKWWhen the teachers talked about Robert's stubborn behavior, she said, Robert lives in a world of his own making.XYFNKWI know he's my son, but I sometimes have the feeling that he came not from my husband and me, but from another place to which he's trying to return.XYFNKWI appreciate your interest in him, and I'll try once more to encourage him to do better in school...But he had been content to read all the adventure and travel books in the local library and kept to himself otherwise, spending days along the river that ran through the edge of town, ignoring proms and football games and other things that bored him.XYFNKWHe fished and swam and walked and lay in long grass listening to distant voices he fancied only he could hear.XYFNKWThere are wizards out there, he used to say to himself.XYFNKWIf you're quiet and open enough to hear them, they're out there.XYFNKWAnd he wished he had a dog to share these moments..There was no money for college.XYFNKWAnd no desire for it, either.XYFNKWHis father worked hard and was good to his mother and him, but the job in a factory didn't leave much for other things, including the care of a dog.XYFNKWHe was eighteen when his father died, so with the Great Depression bearing down hard, he enlisted in the army as a way of supporting his mother and himself.XYFNKWHe stayed there four years, but those four years changed his life..He was assigned to a job, as photographer's assistant, though he had no idea of even how to load a camera.XYFNKWBut in that work, he discovered his profession.XYFNKWThe technical details were easy for him.XYFNKWWithin a month, he was not only doing the darkroom work for two of the staff photographers, but also was allowed to shoot simple projects himself...Robert Kincaid checked out photo books and art books from the town library and studied them.XYFNKWEarly on, he particularly liked the French impressionists and Rembrandt's use of light...Eventually he began to see that light was what he photographed, not objects.XYFNKWThe objects merely were the vehicles for reflecting the light.XYFNKWIf the light was good, you could always find something to photograph.XYFNKWThe 35-millimeter camera was beginning to emerge then, and he purchased a used Leica at a local camera store.XYFNKWHe took it down to New Jersey, and spent a week of his leave there photographing life along the shore..He began keeping notes of his camera settings and places he wanted to visit again.XYFNKWWhen he came out of the army at twenty-two, he was a pretty decent shooter and found work in New York assisting a well-known fashion photographer..The female models were beautiful he dated a few and fell partially in love with one before she moved to Paris and they drifted apart.XYFNKWShe had said to him: Robert, I don't know who or what you are for sure, but please come visit me in Paris.XYFNKWHe told her he would, meant it when he said it, but never got there.XYFNKWYears later when he was doing a story on the beaches of Normandy, he found her name in the Paris book, called, and they had coffee at an outdoor cafe.XYFNKWShe was married to a cinema director and had three children...He couldn't get very keen on the idea of fashion.XYFNKWPeople threw away perfectly good clothes or hastily had them made over according to the instructions of European fashion dictators.XYFNKWIt seemed dumb to him, and he felt lessened doing the photography.XYFNKWYou are what you produce, he said as he left this work...His mother died during his second year in New York.XYFNKWHe went back to Ohio, buried her, and sat before a lawyer, listening to the reading of the will.XYFNKWThere wasn't much.XYFNKWHe didn't expect there would be anything.XYFNKWBut he was surprised to find his parents had accumulated a little fortune in the tiny house where they had lived all their married lives.XYFNKWHe sold the house and bought first-class equipment with the money.XYFNKWAs he paid the camera salesman, he thought of the years his father had worked for those dollars and the plain life his parents had led..Some of his work began to appear in small magazines.XYFNKWThen National Geographic called.XYFNKWThey had seen a calendar shot he had taken out in Maine.XYFNKWHe talked with them, got a minor assignment, executed it professionally, and was on his way...The military asked him back in 1943.XYFNKWHe went with the marines and slogged his way up South Pacific beaches, cameras swinging from his shoulders, lying on his back, photographing the men coming off amphibious landing craft.XYFNKWHe saw the terror on their faces, felt it himself.XYFNKWSaw them cut in two by machine-gun fire, saw them plead to God and their mothers for help.XYFNKWHe got it all, survived, and never got drawn by glory and romance of war photography...Coming out of the service in 1945, he called National Geographic.XYFNKWThey were ready for him, anytime.XYFNKWHe bought a motorcycle in San Francisco, then turned north to explore Washington.XYFNKWHe liked it there and decided to make it his base..Now, at fifty-two, he was still watching the light.XYFNKWHe had been to most of the places posted on his boyhood walls and felt happy when he visited them..The Lake Superior shore was as nice as he'd heard it was.XYFNKWHe marked down several locations for future reference, took some shots to jog his memory later on, and headed south along the Mississippi River toward Iowa.XYFNKWHe'd never been to Iowa but was taken with the hills of the northeast part along the big river..Cutting over to U.S.XYFNKWRoute 65, he went through Des Moines early on a Monday morning, August 16, 1965, turned west at Iowa 92 and headed for Madison County and the covered bridges that were supposed to be there, according to National Geographic.XYFNKWThey were there all right, the man in the Texaco station said so and gave him directions to all seven..The first six were easy to find as he mapped out his strategy for photographing them.XYFNKWThe seventh, a place called Roseman Bridge, eluded him.XYFNKWIt was hot, he was hot, Harry - his truck - was hot, and he was wandering around on gravel roads that seemed to lead nowhere except to the next gravel road...In foreign countries, his rule of thumb was, Ask three times.XYFNKWHe had discovered that three responses, even if they all were wrong, gradually vectored you in to where you wanted to go.XYFNKWMaybe twice would be enough here...A mailbox was coming up, sitting at the end of a lane about one hundred yards long.XYFNKWThe name on the box read Richard Johnson, RR 2.XYFNKWHe slowed down and turned up the lane, looking for guidance..When he drove into the yard, a woman was sitting on the front porch.XYFNKWIt looked cool there, and she was drinking something that looked even cooler.XYFNKWShe came off the porch toward him.XYFNKWHe stepped from the truck and looked at her, looked closer, and then closer still.XYFNKWShe was lovely, or had been at one time, or could be again.XYFNKWAnd immediately he began to feel the old clumsiness he always suffered around women to whom he was attracted....Francesca..Deep autumn was birthday time for Francesca, and cold rain beat against her house in the south Iowa countryside.XYFNKWShe watched the rain, thinking of Richard.XYFNKWHe had died on a day like this, eight years ago, from something with a name she would rather not remember.XYFNKWBut Francesca thought of him now and his kindness, his steady ways, and the life he had given her...The children had called.XYFNKWNeither of them could come home again this year for her birthday, though it was her sixty-seventh.XYFNKWShe understood, as she always did.XYFNKWAlways had.XYFNKWAlways would.XYFNKWThey were both in midcareer, running hard, managing a hospital, teaching students, Michael starting his second marriage, Carolyn struggling with her first.XYFNKWSecretly she was glad they never seemed to arrange a visit on her birthday she had her own ceremonies reserved for that day...This morning her friends from Winterset had stopped by with a birthday cake.XYFNKWFrancesca made coffee, while the talk ran to grandchildren and the town, to Thanksgiving and what to get for Christmas for whom.XYFNKWThe quiet laughter and the rise and fall of conversation from the living room were comforting and reminded Francesca of one small reason why she had stayed here after Richard's death..Michael had touted Florida, Carolyn New England.XYFNKWBut she had remained in the hills of south Iowa, on the land, keeping her old address for a special reason, and she was glad she had done that..Francesca had watched her friends leave at lunchtime.XYFNKWThey drove their Buicks and Fords down the lane, turned onto the paved county road, and headed toward Winterset, wiper blades pushing aside the rain.XYFNKWThey were good friends, though they would never understand what lay inside of her, would not understand even if she told them..Her husband had said she would find good friends, when he brought her here after the war, from Naples.XYFNKWHe said, Iowans have their faults, but one of them is not lack of caring.XYFNKWAnd that was true, is true...She had been twenty-five when.they met - out of the university for three years, teaching at a private school for girls, wondering about her life.XYFNKWMost of the young Italian men were dead or injured or in POW camps.XYFNKWHer affair with Niccolo, a professor of art at the university, who painted all day and took her on wild, reckless tours of the underside of Naples at night, had been over for a year, by the strong disapproval of her traditional parents...She wore ribbons in her black hair and had her sweet dreams.XYFNKWBut no handsome sailors were looking for her, no voices came up to her window from the streets below.XYFNKWFinally, she recognized that her choices were limited.XYFNKWRichard offered a reasonable alternative: kindness and the sweet promise of America..She had studied him in his soldier's uniform as they sat in a cafe in the Mediterranean sunlight, saw him looking earnestly at her in his way, and came to Iowa with him.XYFNKWCame to have his children, to watch Michael play football on cold October nights, to take Carolyn to Des Moines for her prom dresses.XYFNKWShe exchanged letters with her sister in Naples several times each year and had returned there twice, when each of her parents had died.XYFNKWBut Madison County was home now, and she had no wish to go back again..The rain stopped in mid-afternoon, then resumed its ways just before evening.XYFNKWIn the twilight, Francesca poured a small glass of brandy and opened the bottom drawer of Richard's desk.XYFNKWShe took out a manila envelope and brushed her hand across it slowly, as she did each year on this day...The postmark read Seattle, WA, Sep 12 '65.XYFNKWShe always looked at the postmark first.XYFNKWThat was part of the ritual.XYFNKWThen to the address written in longhand: Francesca Johnson, RR 2, Winterset, Iowa.XYFNKWNext the return address, carelessly scrabbled in the upper left: Box 642, Bellingham, Washington.XYFNKWShe sat in a chair by the window, looked at the addresses which contained the movement of his hands, and she wanted to bring back the feel of those hands on her twenty-two years ago...When she could feel his hands touching her, she opened the envelope, carefully removed three letters, two photographs, and a complete issue of National Geographic along with clippings from other issues of the magazine.XYFNKWThere, in gray light, she sipped her brandy, looking over the rim of her glass to the handwritten note clipped on one of the letters.XYFNKWThe letter was on his stationery, that said only Robert Kincaid, Writer-Photographer at the top...September 10, 1965.Dear Francesca,.Enclosed are two photographs.XYFNKWOne is the shot I took of you in the pasture at sunrise.XYFNKWI hope you like it as much as I do.XYFNKWThe other is of Roseman Bridge before I removed your note tacked to it..I sit here recalling every detail, every moment, of our time together.XYFNKWI ask myself over and over, What happened to me in Madison County, Iowa?XYFNKWAnd I struggle to bring it together..I look down the barrel of a lens, and you 're at the end of it.XYFNKWI begin work on an article, and I'm writing about you.XYFNKWI'm not even sure how I got back here from Iowa.XYFNKWSomehow, the old truck brought me home, yet I barely remember the miles going by..A few weeks ago, I felt self-contained, reasonably content.XYFNKWMaybe not really happy, maybe a little lonely, but at least content.XYFNKWAll of that has changed...It's clear to me now that I have been moving toward you and you toward me for a long time.XYFNKWThough neither of us was aware of the other before we met, there was a kind of mindless certainty that we would come together.XYFNKWLike two solitary birds flying the great prairies, all of these years and lifetimes we have been moving toward one another...The road is a strange place.XYFNKWDriving along, I looked up and you were there walking across the grass toward my truck on an August day.XYFNKWIn retrospect, it seems inevitable - it could not have been any other way - a case of what I call the high probability of the improbable.So here, I am walking around with another person inside of me.XYFNKWAnd lam stalked now by that other entity..Somehow, we must see each other again.XYFNKWAnyplace, anytime..Call me if you ever need anything or simply want to see me.XYFNKWI'll be there, pronto.XYFNKWLet me know if you can come out here sometime - anytime.XYFNKWI can arrange plane fare, if that's a problem.XYFNKWI'm off to southeast India next week, but I'll be back in late October..I Love You,.Robert.P.XYFNKWS.XYFNKWThe photo project in Madison County turned out fine.XYFNKWLook for it in NG next year.XYFNKWOr tell me if you want me to send a copy of the issue when it's published...Francesca Johnson set her brandy glass on the wide oak windowsill and stared at an eight-by-ten black-and-white photograph of herself.XYFNKWSometimes it was hard for her to remember how she had looked then, twenty-two years ago.XYFNKWIn tight faded jeans, sandals, and a white T-shirt, her hair blowing in the morning wind as she leaned against a fence post...Through the rain, from her place by the window, she could see the post where the old fence still went around the pasture.XYFNKWWhen she rented out the land, after Richard died, she insisted that the pasture must be kept intact, left untouched, even though it was empty now and had turned to meadow grass...The first serious lines were just beginning to show on her face in the photograph.XYFNKWHis camera had found them.XYFNKWStill, she was pleased with what she saw.XYFNKWHer hair was black, and her body was full and warm, filling out the jeans just about right.XYFNKWYet it was her face at which she stared.XYFNKWIt was the face of a woman in love with the man taking the picture..She could see him clearly also, down the flow of her memory.XYFNKWEach year she ran all of the images through her mind, remembering everything, forgetting nothing.XYFNKWHe was tall and thin and hard, and he moved like the grass itself, without effort, gracefully.XYFNKWHis silver-gray hair hung well below his ears and nearly always looked disheveled, as if he had just come in from a long sea voyage through a stiff wind and had tried to brush it into place with his hands..His narrow face, high cheekbones, and hair falling over his forehead set off light blue eyes that seemed never to stop looking for the next photograph.XYFNKWHe had smiled at her, saying how fine and warm she looked in early light, asked her to lean against the post, and then moved around her in a wide arc, shooting from knee level, then standing, then lying on his back with the camera pointed up at her..She had been slightly embarrassed at the amount of film he used but pleased by the amount of attention he paid to her.XYFNKWShe hoped none of the neighbors were out early on their tractors.XYFNKWThough on that particular morning she hadn't cared too much about neighbors and what they thought..He shot, loaded film, changed lenses, changed cameras, shot some more, and talked quietly to her as he worked, always telling her how good she looked to him and how much he loved her.XYFNKWFrancesca, you're incredibly beautiful.XYFNKWSometimes he stopped and just stared at her, through her, around her, inside of her..Her nipples were clearly outlined where they pressed against the cotton T-shirt.XYFNKWShe had been strangely unconcerned about that, about being naked under the shirt.XYFNKWMore, she was glad of it and was warmed knowing that he could see her breasts so clearly down his lenses.XYFNKWN ever would she have dressed this way around Richard.XYFNKWHe would not have approved..Robert had asked her to arch her back ever so slightly, and he had whispered then, Yes, yes, that's it, stay there.XYFNKWThat was when he had taken the photograph at which she now stared.XYFNKWThe light was perfect, that's what he had said - cloudy bright was his name for it - and the shutter clicked steadily as he moved around her..He was lithe that was the word she had thought of while watching him.XYFNKWAt fifty-two, his body was all lean muscle, muscle that moved with the kind of intensity and power that comes only to men who work hard and take care of themselves..She looked at the picture again, studied it.XYFNKWI did look good, she thought, smiling to herself at the mild self-admiration.XYFNKWI never looked that good before or after.XYFNKWIt was him.XYFNKWAnd she took another sip of brandy while the rain went on..Robert Kincaid was a magician of sorts, who lived within himself.XYFNKWFrancesca had sensed as much immediately on a hot, dry Monday in August 1965, when he stepped out of his truck onto her driveway.XYFNKWRichard and the children were at the Illinois State Fair, exhibiting the prize steer that received more attention than she did, and she had the week to herself...She had been sitting on the front porch swing, drinking iced tea, watching the dust from under a pickup coming down the county road.XYFNKWThe truck was moving slowly, as if the driver were looking for something, stopped just short of her lane, then turned up it toward the house.XYFNKWOh, God, she had thought.XYFNKWWho's this?.She was barefoot, wearing jeans and a faded blue work- shirt with the sleeves rolled up, shirttail out.XYFNKWHer long black hair was fastened up by a tortoiseshell comb her father had given her when she left the old country.XYFNKWThe truck rolled up the lane and stopped near the gate to the wire fence surrounding the house..Francesca stepped off the porch and walked unhurriedly through the grass toward the gate.XYFNKWAnd out of the pickup came Robert Kincaid, looking like some vision from a never- written book called An Illustrated History of Shamans..His military-style shirt was tacked down to his back with perspiration there were wide, dark circles of it under his arms.XYFNKWThe top three buttons were undone, and she could see tight chest muscles just below the plain silver chain around his neck.XYFNKWOver his shoulders were wide orange suspenders, the kind worn by people who spent a lot of time in wilderness areas..He smiled.XYFNKWI'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a covered bridge out this way, and I can't find it.XYFNKWI think I'm lost.XYFNKWHe wiped his forehead and smiled again..His eyes looked directly at her, and she felt something jump inside.XYFNKWThe eyes, the voice, the face, the silver hair, the easy way he moved his body, disturbing ways, ways that draw you in.XYFNKWWays that whisper to you in the final moment before sleep comes, when the barriers have fallen.XYFNKWWays that rearrange the molecular space between male and female...The ways are simple we have made them seem complicated.XYFNKWFrancesca sensed this without knowing she was sensing it, sensed it at the level of her cells.XYFNKWAnd there began the thing that would change her forever...A car went past on the road, trailing dust behind it, and honked.XYFNKWFrancesca waved back at Floyd Clark's brown arm sticking out of his Chevy and turned back to the stranger.XYFNKWYou're pretty close.XYFNKWThe bridge is only about two miles from here.XYFNKWThen, after twenty years of living the close life, a life demanded by a rural culture, Francesca Johnson surprised herself by saying, I'll be glad to show it to you, if you want..Why she did that, she never had been sure.XYFNKWA young girl's feelings rising like a bubble through water and bursting out, maybe, after all these years.XYFNKWShe was not shy, but not forward, either.XYFNKWThe only thing she could ever conclude was that Robert Kincaid had drawn her in somehow, after only a few seconds of looking at him..He was obviously taken aback, slightly, by her offer.XYFNKWBut he recovered quickly and with a serious look on his face said he'd appreciate that.XYFNKWShe picked up the cowboy boots she wore for farm chores and walked out to his truck, following him around to the passenger side..Just take me a minute to make room for you lots of gear 'n' stuff in here.XYFNKWHe mumbled mostly to himself as he worked, and she could tell he was a little flustered, and a little shy about the whole affair..He was rearranging canvas bags and tripods, a Thermos bottle and paper sacks.XYFNKWIn the back of the pickup were an old brown suitcase and a guitar case, both dusty and battered, both tied to a spare tire with a piece of clothesline rope...He mumbled and sorted and stuffed paper coffee cups and banana peels into a brown grocery bag that he tossed into the truck box when he was finished.XYFNKWFinally, he removed a blue-and-white ice chest and put that in the back as well.XYFNKWIn faded red paint on the green truck door was printed Kincaid Photography, Bellingham, Washington...Okay, I think you can squeeze in there now.XYFNKWHe held the door, closed it behind her, then went around to the driver's side and with a peculiar, animal-like grace stepped in behind the wheel.XYFNKWHe looked at her, just a quick glance, smiled slightly, and said, Which way?Right.XYFNKWShe motioned with her hand.XYFNKWHe turned the key, and the engine started.XYFNKWBouncing, the truck moved along the lane toward the road..He leaned over and reached into the glove compartment, his forearm accidentally brushing across her lower thigh.XYFNKWLooking half out the windshield and half into the compartment, he took out a business card and handed it to her.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid, Writer-Photographer.XYFNKWHis address was printed there, along with a phone number..I'm out here on assignment for National Geographic, he said.XYFNKWYou familiar with the magazine?Yes.XYFNKWFrancesca nodded, thinking, Isn't everybody?XYFNKWThey're doing a piece on covered bridges, and Madison County, Iowa, apparently has some interesting ones.XYFNKWI've located six of them, but I guess there's at least one more, and it's supposed to be out in this direction..It's called Roseman Bridge, said Francesca over the noise of the wind and tires and engine.XYFNKWHer voice sounded strange, as if it belonged to someone else, to a teenage girl leaning out of a window in Naples, looking far down city streets toward the trains or out at the harbor and thinking of distant lovers yet to come.XYFNKWAs she spoke, she watched the muscles in his forearm flex when he shifted gears..Two knapsacks were beside her.XYFNKWThe flap of one was closed, but the other was folded back, and she could see the silver-colored top and black back of a camera sticking out.XYFNKWBehind her feet were two tripods.XYFNKWThey were badly scratched, but she could read part of the worn label on one: Gitzo.XYFNKWWhen he had opened the glove box, she noticed it was crammed with notebooks, maps, pens, loose change, and a carton of Camel cigarettes..Turn right at the next corner, she said.XYFNKWThat gave her an excuse to glance at the profile of Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWHis skin was tanned and smooth and shiny with sweat.XYFNKWHe had nice lips for some reason she had noticed that right away.XYFNKWAnd his nose was like that she had seen on Indian men during a vacation the family had taken out west when the children were young..He wasn't handsome, not in any conventional sense.XYFNKWNor was he homely.XYFNKWThose words didn't seem to apply to him.XYFNKWBut there was something, something about him.XYFNKWSomething very old, something slightly battered by the years, not in his appearance, but in his eyes..On his left wrist was a complicated-looking watch with a brown, sweat-stained leather band.XYFNKWA silver bracelet with some intricate scrollwork clung to his right wrist.XYFNKWIt needed a good rubbing with silver polish, she thought...Robert Kincaid pulled a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket, shook one halfway out, and offered it to her.XYFNKWFor the second time in five minutes, she surprised herself and took the cigarette.XYFNKWWhat am I doing?XYFNKWShe thought.XYFNKWShe had smoked years ago but gave it up under the steady criticism from Richard.XYFNKWHe shook out another one, put it between his lips, and flicked a gold lighter into flame, holding it toward her while he kept his eyes on the road...She cupped her hands around the lighter to hold the wind and touched his hand to steady it against the bouncing of the truck.XYFNKWIt took only an instant for her to light the cigarette, but that was long enough to feel the warmth of his hand and the tiny hairs along the back of it..Francesca Johnson, fanner's wife, rested against the dusty truck seat, smoked the cigarette, and pointed.XYFNKWThere it is, just around the curve.XYFNKWThe old bridge, red in color, tilting slightly from all the years, sat across a small stream..Robert Kincaid had smiled then.XYFNKWHe quickly looked at her and said, It's great.XYFNKWA sunrise shot.XYFNKWHe stopped a hundred feet from the bridge and got out, taking the open knapsack with him.XYFNKWI'm going to look around for a few minutes, do you mind?XYFNKWShe shook her head and smiled back..Francesca watched him walk up the country road, taking a camera from the knapsack and then slinging the bag over his left shoulder.XYFNKWHe had done that thousands of times, that exact movement.XYFNKWAs he walked, his head never stopped moving, looking from side to side, then at the bridge, then at the trees behind the bridge.XYFNKWOnce he turned and looked back at her, his face serious..In contrast with the local folks, who fed on gravy and potatoes and red meat, three times a day for some of them, Robert Kincaid looked as if he ate nothing but fruit and nuts and vegetables.XYFNKWHard, she thought.XYFNKWHe looks hard, physically..It was quiet.XYFNKWA redwing blackbird sat on fence wire and looked in at her.XYFNKWA meadowlark called from the roadside grass.XYFNKWNothing else moved in the white sun of August...Just short of the bridge, Robert Kincaid stopped.XYFNKWHe stood there for a moment, then squatted down, looking through the camera.XYFNKWHe walked to the other side of the road and did the same thing.XYFNKWThen he moved into the cover of the bridge and studied the beams and floor planks, looked at the stream below through a hole in the side...Francesca put out her cigarette, opened the door, and put her boots on the gravel.XYFNKWShe glanced around to make sure none of her neighbors' cars were coming and walked toward the bridge.XYFNKWThe sun was very hot in late afternoon, and it looked cooler inside the bridge.XYFNKWShe could see his silhouette at the other end until he went down toward the stream..Inside, she could hear pigeons burbling softly in their nests and put the palm of her hand on the side planking, feeling the warmth.XYFNKWGraffiti was scrawled on some of the planks: Jimbo-Denison, Iowa.XYFNKWSherry + Dubby.XYFNKWThe pigeons kept on burbling softly..Francesca looked through a crack between two of the side planks, down toward the stream where Robert Kincaid had gone.XYFNKWHe was standing on a rock in the middle of the little river, looking toward the bridge, and she was startled to see him wave.XYFNKWHe jumped back to the bank and moved easily up the steep bank..It's real nice, real pretty here, he said, his voice reverberating inside the covered bridge..Francesca nodded.XYFNKWYes, it is.XYFNKWWe take these old bridges for granted around here and don't think much about them..He walked to her and held out a small bouquet of wildflowers.XYFNKWThanks for the guided tour.XYFNKWHe smiled softly.XYFNKWI'll come back at dawn one of these days' and get my shots.XYFNKWShe felt something inside of her again.XYFNKWFlowers.XYFNKWNobody gave her flowers, even on special occasions...I don't know your name, he said.XYFNKWShe realized then that she had not told him and felt dumb about that.XYFNKWWhen she did, he nodded and said, I caught the smallest trace of an accent.XYFNKWItalian?.Yes.XYFNKWA long time ago..The green truck again.XYFNKWAlong the gravel roads with the sun lowering itself.XYFNKWTwice they met cars, but it was nobody Francesca knew.XYFNKWIn the four minutes it took to reach the farm, she felt that she wanted more of Robert Kincaid, writer- photographer, that's what.XYFNKWShe wanted to know more and clutched the flowers on her lap, held them straight up, like a schoolgirl coming back from an outing..The blood was in her face.XYFNKWShe could feel it.XYFNKWShe hadn't done anything or said anything, but she felt as if she had..He turned the truck up the lane.XYFNKWRichard is your husband?XYFNKWHe had seen the mailbox..Yes, said Francesca, slightly short of breath.XYFNKWIt's pretty hot.XYFNKWWould you like an ice tea?He looked over at her.XYFNKWIf it's all right, I sure would..It's all right, she said..She directed him - casually, she hoped - to park the pickup around behind the house.XYFNKWWhat she didn't need was for Richard to come home and have one of the neighbor men say, Hey, Dick havin' some work done at the place?XYFNKWSaw a green pickup there last week.XYFNKWKnew Frannie was home so I didn't bother to check on it..Up broken cement steps to the back porch door.XYFNKWHe held the door for her, carrying his camera knapsacks.XYFNKWAwful hot to leave the equipment in the truck, he had said when he pulled them out...A little cooler in the kitchen, but still hot.XYFNKWThe collie snuffled around Kincaid's boots, then went out on the back porch and flopped down while Francesca removed ice from metal trays and poured sun tea from a glass jug.XYFNKWShe knew he was watching her as he sat at the kitchen table, long legs stretched in front of him, brushing his hair with both hands...Lemon?Yes, please..Sugar?No, thanks..The lemon juice ran slowly down the side of a glass, and he saw that, too.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid missed little..Francesca set the glass before him.XYFNKWPut her own on the other side of the Formica-topped table and her bouquet in water.XYFNKWLeaning against the counter, she balanced on one leg, bent over, and took off a boot, then the other one..He took a small drink of tea and watched her.XYFNKWShe was about five feet six, fortyish or a little older, pretty face, and a fine, warm body.XYFNKWBut there were pretty women everywhere he traveled.XYFNKWSuch physical matters were nice, yet, to him, intelligence and passion, the ability to move and be moved by subtleties of the mind and spirit, were what really counted.XYFNKWThat's why he found most young women unattractive, regardless of their exterior beauty.XYFNKWThey had not lived long enough or hard enough to possess those qualities that interested him..But there was something in Francesca Johnson that did interest him.XYFNKWThere was intelligence he could sense that.XYFNKWAnd there was passion, though he couldn't quite grasp what that passion was directed toward or if it was directed at all...Later, he would tell her that watching her take off her boots that day was one of the most sensual moments he could remember.XYFNKWWhy was not important.XYFNKWThat was not the way he approached his life.XYFNKWAnalysis destroys wholes.XYFNKWSome things, magic things, are meant to stay whole.XYFNKWIf you look at their pieces, they go away.XYFNKWThat's what he had said...She sat at the table, one leg curled under her, and pulled back strands of hair that had fallen over her face.XYFNKWThen, remembering, she rose and went to the cupboard, took down an ashtray, and set it on the table where he could reach it..With that silent permission, he pulled out a pack of Camels and held it toward her.XYFNKWShe took one and noticed it was slightly wet from his heavy perspiring.XYFNKWSame routine.XYFNKWHe held the gold lighter she touched his hand to steady it, felt his skin with her fingertips, and sat back.XYFNKWThe cigarette tasted wonderful, and she smiled..What is it you do, exactly - I mean with the photography?He looked at his cigarette and spoke quietly.XYFNKWI'm a contract shooter - uh, photographer - for National Geographic, part of the time.XYFNKWI get ideas, sell them to the magazine, and do the shoot.XYFNKWOr they have something they want done and contact me.XYFNKWNot a lot of room for artistic expression it's a pretty conservative publication.XYFNKWBut the pay is decent.XYFNKWNot great, but decent, and steady.XYFNKWThe rest of the time, I write and photograph on my own hook and send pieces to other magazines.XYFNKWIf things get tough, I do corporate work, though I find that awfully confining...Sometimes I write poetry, just for myself.XYFNKWNow and then, I try to write a little fiction, but I don't seem to have a feeling for it.XYFNKWI live north of Seattle and work around that area quite a bit.XYFNKWI like shooting the fishing boats and Indian settlements and landscapes...The Geographic work often keeps me at a location for a couple of months, particularly for a major piece on something like part of the Amazon or the North African desert.XYFNKWOrdinarily I fly to an assignment like this and rent a car.XYFNKWBut I felt like driving through some places and chose them for future reference.XYFNKWI came down along Lake Superior I'll go back through the Black Hills.XYFNKWHow about you?Francesca hadn't expected him to ask.XYFNKWShe stammered for a moment.XYFNKWOh, gosh, nothing like you do.XYFNKWI got my degree in comparative literature.XYFNKWWinterset was having trouble-finding teachers when I arrived here in 1946, and the fact that I was married to a local man who was a veteran made me acceptable.XYFNKWSo I picked up a teaching certificate and taught high school English for a few years.XYFNKWBut Richard didn't like the idea of me working.XYFNKWHe said he could support us, and there was no need for it, particularly when our two children were growing.XYFNKWSo I stopped and became a farm wife full-time.XYFNKWThat's it..She noticed his iced tea was almost gone and poured him some more from the jug..Thanks.XYFNKWHow do you like it here in Iowa?There was a moment of truth in this.XYFNKWShe knew it.XYFNKWThe standard reply was, Just fine.XYFNKWIt's quiet.XYFNKWThe people are real nice..She didn't answer immediately.XYFNKWCould I have another cigarette?XYFNKWAgain, the pack of Camels, again the lighter, again touching his hand, lightly.XYFNKWSunlight walked across the back porch floor and onto the dog, who got up and moved out of sight.XYFNKWFrancesca, for the first time, looked into the eyes of Robert Kincaid...I'm supposed to say, 'Just fine.XYFNKWIt's quiet.XYFNKWThe people are real nice.' All of that's true, mostly.XYFNKWIt is quiet.XYFNKWAnd the people are nice, in certain ways.XYFNKWWe all help each other out.XYFNKWIf someone gets sick or hurt, the neighbors do whatever needs to be done.XYFNKWIn town, you can leave your car unlocked and let your children run without worrying about them.XYFNKWThere are a lot of good things about the people here, and I respect them for those qualities...But - she hesitated, smoked, looked across the table at Robert Kincaid - it's not what I dreamed about as a girl.XYFNKWThe confession, at last.XYFNKWThe words had been there for years, and she had never said them.XYFNKWShe had said them now to a man with a green pickup truck from Bellingham, Washington..He said nothing for a moment.XYFNKWThen: I wrote something in my notebook the other day for future use, just had the idea while driving along that happens a lot.XYFNKWIt goes like this: 'The old dreams were good dreams they didn't work out, but I'm glad I had them.' I'm not sure what that means, but I'll use it somewhere.XYFNKWSo I think I kind of know how you feel..Francesca smiled at him then.XYFNKWFor the first time, she smiled warm and deep.XYFNKWAnd the gambler's instincts took over.XYFNKWWould you like to stay for supper?XYFNKWMy family's away, so I don't have too much on hand, but I can figure out something..Well, I get pretty tired of grocery stores and restaurants.XYFNKWThat's for sure.XYFNKWSo if it's not too much bother, I'd like that..You like pork chops?XYFNKWI could fix that with some vegetables from the garden..Just the vegetables would be fine for me.XYFNKWI don't eat meat.XYFNKWHaven't for years.XYFNKWNo big deal, I just feel better that way...Francesca smiled again.XYFNKWAround here that point of view would not be popular.XYFNKWRichard and his friends would say you're trying to destroy their livelihood.XYFNKWI don't eat much meat myself I'm not sure why, I just don't care for it.XYFNKWBut every time I try a meatless supper on the family, there are howls of rebellion'.XYFNKWSo I've pretty much given up trying.XYFNKWIt'll be fun figuring out something different for a change..Okay, but don't go to a lot of trouble on my account.XYFNKWListen, I need to dump out the melted ice water in my cooler and organize things a bit.XYFNKWIt'll take me a little while.XYFNKWHe stood up and drank the last of his tea...She watched him go through the kitchen doorway, across the porch, and into the yard.XYFNKWHe didn't let the door bang like everyone else did but instead shut it gently.XYFNKWJust before he went out, he squatted down to pet the collie, who valued the attention with several licks along his arms..Upstairs, Francesca ran a quick bath and, while drying off, looked over the top of the curtain toward the farmyard.XYFNKWHis suitcase was open, and he was washing himself, using the old hand pump.XYFNKWShe should have told him he could shower in the house if he wanted.XYFNKWShe had meant to, then refused for a moment at the level of familiarity, and in the end forgot to say anything..But Robert Kincaid had washed up under worse conditions.XYFNKWOut of buckets of rancid water in tiger country, out of his flask in the desert.XYFNKWIn her farmyard, he had stripped to the waist and was using his dirty shirt as a combination of washcloth and towel.XYFNKWA towel, she blamed herself.XYFNKWAt least a towel I could have done that for him...His razor caught the sunlight, where it lay on cement beside the pump, and she watched him soap his face and shave.XYFNKWHe was - there's the word again, she thought - hard.XYFNKWHe wasn't big-bodied, a little over six feet, a little toward thin.XYFNKWBut he had large shoulder muscles for his size, and his belly was flat as a knife blade.XYFNKWHe didn't look however old he was, and he didn't look like the local men with too much gravy over biscuits in the morning...During the last shopping trip to Des Moines, she had bought new perfume - Wind Song - and she used it now.XYFNKWWhat to put on?XYFNKWIt didn't seem right for her to dress up too much, since he was still in his working clothes.XYFNKWLong-sleeved white shirt, sleeves rolled to just below the elbows, a clean pair of jeans, sandals.XYFNKWThe gold hoop earrings Richard said made her look like a hussy and a gold bracelet.XYFNKWHair pulled back with a clip, hanging down her back.XYFNKWThat felt right..When she came into the kitchen, he was sitting there with his knapsacks and cooler, wearing a clean khaki shirt, with the orange suspenders running over it.XYFNKWOn the table were three cameras and five lenses, and a fresh package of Camels.XYFNKWThe equipment was scratched, dented in places.XYFNKWBut he handled it carefully..He looked up at her, serious face again, shy face.XYFNKWI have some beer in the cooler.XYFNKWLike one?Yes, that would be nice..He took out two bottles of Budweiser.XYFNKWFrancesca started looking for an opener in a drawer.XYFNKWBut he said, I've got it.XYFNKWHe took the Swiss Army knife from its case on his belt and flicked out the bottle opener on it, using it expertly..He handed her a bottle and raised his in a half salute: To covered bridges in the late afternoon or, better yet, on warm, red mornings.XYFNKWHe grinned..Francesca said nothing but smiled softly and raised her bottle a little, hesitantly, awkwardly.XYFNKWA strange stranger, flowers, perfume, beer, and a toast on a hot Monday in late summer.XYFNKWIt was almost more than she could deal with...There was somebody a long time ago who was thirsty on an August afternoon.XYFNKWWhoever it was studied their thirst and invented beer.XYFNKWThat's where it came from, and a problem was solved.XYFNKWHe was working on a camera, almost talking to it...I'm going out to the garden for a minute.XYFNKWI'll be right back..He looked up.XYFNKWNeed help?She shook her head and walked past him, feeling his eyes on her hips, wondering if he watched her all the way across the porch, guessing that he did..She was right.XYFNKWHe watched her.XYFNKWShook his head and looked again.XYFNKWWatched her body, thought of the intelligence he knew she possessed, wondered about the other things he sensed in her.XYFNKWHe was drawn to her, fighting it back..The garden was in shade now.XYFNKWFrancesca moved through it with a dishpan.XYFNKWShe gathered carrots and parsley, some parsnips and onions and turnips..When she entered the kitchen, Robert Kincaid was repacking the knapsacks, neatly and precisely, she noticed.XYFNKWEverything obviously had its place and always was placed in its place.XYFNKWHe had finished his beer and opened two more, even though she was not quite done with hers.XYFNKWShe tilted back her head and finished the first one, handing him the empty bottle..Can I do something?XYFNKWhe asked..You can bring in the watermelon from the porch and a few potatoes from the bucket out there..He moved so easily that she was amazed at how quickly he went to the porch and returned melon under his arm, four potatoes in his hands.XYFNKWEnough?She nodded, thinking how ghostlike he seemed.XYFNKWHe set them on the counter beside the sink where she was cleaning the garden vegetables and returned to his chair, lighting a Camel as he sat down...How long will you be here?XYFNKWshe asked, looking down at the vegetables she was working on...I'm not sure.XYFNKWProbably about a week.XYFNKWThis is a slow time for me, and my deadline for the bridge pictures is still three weeks away..Where are you staying?XYFNKWIn town?Yes.XYFNKWA little place with cabins.XYFNKWSomething-or-other Motor Court.XYFNKWI just checked in this morning.XYFNKWHaven't even unloaded my gear yet..That's the only place to stay, except for Mrs.XYFNKWCarlson's she takes in roomers.XYFNKWThe restaurants will be a disappointment, though, particularly for someone with your eating habits..I know.XYFNKWIt's an old story.XYFNKWBut I've learned to make do.XYFNKWThis time of year it's not so bad I can find fresh produce in the stores and at stands along the road.XYFNKWBread and a few other things, and I make it work.XYFNKWIt's nice to be invited out like this, though.XYFNKWI appreciate it..She reached along the counter and turned on a small radio.XYFNKWWith time in my pocket, and the weather on my side a voice sang, guitars playing along.XYFNKWShe kept the volume low..I'm pretty good at chopping vegetables, he offered..Okay, there's the cutting board, a knife's in the drawer right below it.XYFNKWI'm going to fix a stew, so kind of cube the vegetables..He stood two feet from her, looking down, cutting and chopping the carrots and turnips, parsnips and onions.XYFNKWFrancesca peeled potatoes into the sink, aware of being so close to a strange man...You play the guitar?XYFNKWI saw the case in your truck...A little bit.XYFNKWIt keeps me company, not too much more than that.XYFNKWMy wife was an early folkie, way before the music became popular, and she got me going on it..Francesca had stiffened slightly at the word wife.XYFNKWWhy, she didn't know.XYFNKWHe had a right to be married, but somehow it didn't fit him.XYFNKWShe didn't want him to be married..She couldn't stand the long shoots when I'd be gone for months.XYFNKWI don't blame her.XYFNKWShe pulled out nine years ago.XYFNKWDivorced me a year later.XYFNKWWe never had children, so it wasn't complicated.XYFNKWTook one guitar, left the el cheapo with me..You hear from her?No, never..That was all he said.XYFNKWFrancesca didn't push it.XYFNKWBut she felt better, selfishly, and wondered again why she should care one way or the other..I've been to Italy, twice, he said.XYFNKWWhere you from, originally?Naples..Never made it there.XYFNKWI was in the north once, doing some shooting along the River Po.XYFNKWThen again for a piece on Sicily..Francesca peeled potatoes, thinking of Italy for a moment, aware of Robert Kincaid beside her...Clouds had moved up in the west, cutting the sun into rays.XYFNKWHe looked out the window above the sink and said, God light.XYFNKWCalendar companies love it.XYFNKWSo do religious magazines...Your work sounds interesting, Francesca said.XYFNKWShe felt a need to keep neutral conversation going..It is.XYFNKWI like it a lot.XYFNKWI like the road, and I like making pictures..She noticed he'd said making pictures.XYFNKWYou make pictures, not take them?Yes.XYFNKWAt least that's how I think of it.XYFNKWThat's the difference between Sunday snap-shooters and someone who does it for a living.XYFNKWWhen I'm finished with that bridge we saw today, it won't look quite like you expect.XYFNKWI'll have made it into something of my own, by lens choice, or camera angle, or general composition, and most likely by some combination of all of those..I don't just take things as given I try to make them into something that reflects my personal consciousness, my spirit.XYFNKWI try to find the poetry in the image.XYFNKWThe magazine has its own style and demands, and I don't always agree with the editors' taste in fact, most of the time I don't.XYFNKWAnd that bothers them, even though they decide what goes in and what gets left out.XYFNKWI guess they know their readership, but I wish they'd take a few more chances now and then.XYFNKWI tell them that, and it bothers them..That's the problem in earning a living through an art form.XYFNKWYou're always dealing with markets, and markets-mass markets - are designed to suit average tastes.XYFNKWThat's where the numbers are.XYFNKWThat's the reality, I guess.XYFNKWBut, as I said, it can become pretty confining.XYFNKWThey let me keep the shots they don't use, so at least I have my own private files of stuff I like...And, once in a while, another magazine will take one or two, or I can write an article on a place I've been and illustrate it with something a little more daring than National Geographic prefers...Sometime I'm going to do an essay called 'The Virtues of Amateurism' for all of those people who wish they earned their living in the arts.XYFNKWThe market kills more artistic passion than anything else.XYFNKWIt's a world of safety out there, for most people.XYFNKWThey want safety, the magazines and manufacturers give them safety, give them the familiar and comfortable, don't challenge them..Profit dominates art.XYFNKWWe're all getting lashed to the great wheel of uniformity..The marketing people are always talking about something called 'consumers.' I have this image of a fat little man in baggy Bermuda shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and a straw hat with beer-can openers dangling from it, clutching handfuls of dollars..Francesca laughed quietly, thinking about safety and comfort..But I'm not complaining too much.XYFNKWLike I said, the traveling is good, and I like fooling with cameras and being out of doors.XYFNKWThe reality is not exactly what the song started out to be, but it's not a bad song..Francesca supposed that, for Robert Kincaid, this was everyday talk.XYFNKWFor her, it was the stuff of literature.XYFNKWPeople in Madison County didn't talk this way, about these things.XYFNKWThe talk was about weather and farm prices and new babies and funerals and government programs and athletic teams.XYFNKWNot about art and dreams.XYFNKWNot about realities that kept the music silent, the dreams in a box..He finished chopping vegetables.XYFNKWAnything else I can do?.She shook her head.XYFNKWNo, it's about under control...He sat at the table again, smoking, taking a drink of beer now and then.XYFNKWShe cooked, sipping on her beer between tasks.XYFNKWShe could feel the alcohol, even this small amount of it.XYFNKWOn New Year's Eve, at the City Hall, she and Richard would have some drinks.XYFNKWOther than that, not much, and there seldom was liquor in the house, except for a bottle of brandy she had bought once in some hope for romance in their country lives.XYFNKWThe bottle was still unopened..Vegetable oil, one and one-half cups of vegetables.XYFNKWCook until light brown.XYFNKWAdd flour and mix well.XYFNKWAdd water, a pint of it.XYFNKWAdd remaining vegetables and seasonings.XYFNKWCook slowly, about forty minutes..With the cooking underway, Francesca sat across from him once again.XYFNKWModest intimacy fell upon the kitchen.XYFNKWIt came, somehow, from the cooking.XYFNKWFixing supper for a stranger, with him chopping turnips beside you, removed some of the strangeness.XYFNKWAnd with the loss of strangeness, there was space for intimacy..He pushed the cigarettes toward her, the lighter on top of the package.XYFNKWShe shook one out, fumbled with the lighter, felt clumsy.XYFNKWIt wouldn't catch.XYFNKWHe smiled a little, carefully took the lighter from her hand, and flipped the wheel twice before it caught.XYFNKWHe held it, she lit her cigarette.XYFNKWAround men she usually felt graceful in comparison to them.XYFNKWNot around Robert Kincaid, though...A white sun had turned big red and lay just over the com fields.XYFNKWThrough the kitchen window, she could see a hawk.XYFNKWThe seven o'clock news and market summary were on the radio.XYFNKWAnd Francesca looked across the yellow Formica toward Robert Kincaid, who had come a long way to her kitchen.XYFNKWA long way, across more than miles...It already smells good, he said, pointing toward the stove.XYFNKWIt smells quiet.XYFNKWHe looked at her..Quiet?XYFNKWCould something smell quiet?XYFNKWShe was thinking about the phrase, asking herself.XYFNKWHe was right.XYFNKWAfter the pork chops and steaks and roasts she cooked for the family, this was quiet cooking.XYFNKWThe stew cooked quietly and smelled quiet.XYFNKWIt was quiet here in the kitchen..If you don't mind, tell me a little about your life in Italy.XYFNKWHe was stretched out on the chair, his right leg crossed over his left at the ankles..Silence bothered her around him, so she talked.XYFNKWTold him about her growing years, the private school, the nuns, her parents - housewife, bank manager.XYFNKWAbout standing along the sea wall as a teenager and watching ships from all over the world.XYFNKWAbout the American soldiers that came later.XYFNKWAbout meeting Richard in a cafe where she and some girlfriends were drinking coffee.XYFNKWThe war had destroyed lives, and they wondered if they would ever get married.XYFNKWShe was silent about Niccolo..He listened, saying nothing, nodding in understanding occasionally.XYFNKWWhen she finally paused, he said, And you have children, did you say?Yes.XYFNKWMichael is seventeen.XYFNKWCarolyn is sixteen.XYFNKWThey both go to a farming school in Winterset, that's why now they're at the Illinois State Fair.XYFNKWShowing Carolyn's steer..Something I've never been able to adapt to, to understand, is how they can put such love and care on the animals and then see them sold for slaughter.XYFNKWI don't dare say anything about it, though.XYFNKWRichard and his friends would be down on me in a flash.XYFNKWBut there's some kind of cold, unfeeling contradiction in that business...She felt guilty mentioning Richard's name.XYFNKWShe hadn't done anything, anything at all.XYFNKWYet she could feel guilt, a guilt born of distant possibilities.XYFNKWAnd she wondered how to manage the end of the evening and if she had gotten herself into something she couldn't handle.XYFNKWMaybe Robert Kincaid would just leave.XYFNKWHe seemed pretty quiet, nice enough, even a little bashful...As they talked on, the evening turned blue, light fog covering the meadow grass.XYFNKWHe opened two more beers for them while Francesca's stew cooked, quietly.XYFNKWShe rose and dropped dumplings into boiling water, turned, and leaned against the sink, feeling warm toward Robert Kincaid from Bellingham, Washington.XYFNKWHoping he wouldn't leave too early..He ate two helpings of the stew with quiet good manners and told her twice how line it was.XYFNKWThe watermelon was perfect.XYFNKWThe beer was cold.XYFNKWThe evening was blue.XYFNKWFrancesca Johnson was forty-five years old, and Hank Snow sang a train song on KMA, Iowa....Ancient Evenings, Distant Music..Now what?XYFNKWthought Francesca.XYFNKWSupper over, sitting there..He took care of it.XYFNKWHow about a walk out in the meadow?XYFNKWIt's cooling down a little.XYFNKWWhen she said yes, he reached into a knapsack and pulled out a camera, putting the strap over his shoulder...Kincaid pushed open the back porch door and held it for her, followed her out, then shut it gently.XYFNKWThey went down the cracked sidewalk, across the graveled farmyard, and onto the grass east of the house...When they came to the fence, she held down the barbed wire with one hand and stepped over it, feeling the dew on her feet around the thin sandal straps.XYFNKWHe executed the same maneuver, easily swinging his boots over the wire..Do you call this a meadow or a pasture?XYFNKWhe asked..Pasture, I guess.XYFNKWThe cattle keep the grass short.XYFNKWWatch out for their leavings.XYFNKWA moon nearly full was coming up the eastern sky, which had turned azure with the sun just under the horizon.XYFNKWOn the road below, a car rocketed past, loud muffler.XYFNKWThe Clark boy.XYFNKWQuarterback on the Winterset team.XYFNKWDated Judy Leverenson..It had been a long time since she had taken a walk like this.XYFNKWAfter supper, which was always at five, there was the television news, then the evening programs, watched by Richard and sometimes by the children when they had finished their homework.XYFNKWFrancesca usually read in the kitchen - books from the Winterset library and the book club she belonged to, history and poetry and fiction - or sat on the front porch in good weather.XYFNKWThe television bored her..When Richard would call, Frannie, you've got to see this!XYFNKWshe'd go in and sit with him for a while.XYFNKWElvis always generated such a summons.XYFNKWSo did the Beatles when they first appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show.XYFNKWRichard looked at their hair and kept shaking his head in disbelief and disapproval...For a short time, red streaks cut across part of the sky.XYFNKWI call that 'bounce,' Robert Kincaid said, pointing upward.XYFNKWMost people put their cameras away too soon.XYFNKWAfter the sun goes down, there's often a period of really nice light and color in the sky, just for a few minutes, when the sun is below the horizon but bounces its light off the sky...Francesca said nothing, wondering about a man to whom the difference between a pasture and a meadow seemed important, who got excited about sky color, who wrote a little poetry but not much fiction.XYFNKWWho played the guitar, who earned his living by images and carried his tools in knapsacks.XYFNKWWho seemed like the wind.XYFNKWAnd moved like it.XYFNKWCame from it, perhaps..He looked upward, hands in his Levies pockets, camera hanging against his left hip..The silver apples of the moon,.The golden apples of the sun..His baritone said the words like that of a professional actor..She looked over at him.XYFNKWW.XYFNKWB.XYFNKWYeats, 'The Song of Wandering Aengus..Right.XYFNKWGood stuff, Yeats.XYFNKWRealism, economy, sensuousness, beauty, magic.XYFNKWAppeals to my Irish heritage..He had said it all, right there in five words.XYFNKWFrancesca had tried to explain Yeats to the Winterset students but never got through to most of them.XYFNKWShe remembered Matthew Clark looking at the boy beside him and then forming his hands as if to cup them over a woman's breasts when she read, The golden apples of the sun.XYFNKWThey had giggled, and the girls in the back row with them blushed...They would live with those attitudes all their lives.XYFNKWThat's what had discouraged her, in spite of the outward friendliness of the community.XYFNKWPoets were not welcome here.XYFNKWThe people of Madison County liked to say, compensating for their own sense of cultural inferiority, This is a good place to raise kids.XYFNKWAnd she always felt like responding, But is it a good place to raise adults?.Without any conscious plan, they had walked slowly into the pasture a few hundred yards, made a loop, and were headed back toward the house.XYFNKWDarkness came about them as they crossed the fence, with him pushing down the wire for her this time..She remembered the brandy.XYFNKWI have some brandy.XYFNKWOr would you like some coffee?Is the possibility of both open?XYFNKWHis words came out of the darkness.XYFNKWShe knew he was smiling..As they came into the circle made on grass and gravel by the yard light, she answered, Of course, hearing the sound of something in her voice that worried her.XYFNKWIt was the sound of easy laughter in the cafes of Naples..It was difficult finding two cups without some kind of chip on them.XYFNKWThough she was sure that chipped cups were part of his life, she wanted perfect ones this time.XYFNKWThe brandy glasses, two of them back in the cupboard, turned upside down, had never been used, like the brandy.XYFNKWShe had to stretch on her tiptoes to reach them and was aware of her wet sandals and the jeans stretched tight across her bottom..He sat on the same chair he had used before and watched her.XYFNKWThe old ways.XYFNKWThe old ways coming into him again.XYFNKWHe wondered how her hair would feel to his touch, how the curve of her back would fit his hand, how she would feel underneath him..He tried to think of something else, photography or the road or covered bridges.XYFNKWAnything but how she looked just now...But he failed and wondered again how it would feel to touch her skin, to put his belly against hers.XYFNKWThe questions eternal, and always the same.XYFNKWThe goddamned old ways, fighting toward the surface.XYFNKWHe tried to suppress them, lit a Camel, and breathed deeply...She could feel his eyes on her constantly, though his watching was careful, never obvious, never intrusive.XYFNKWShe knew that he knew brandy had never been poured into those glasses.XYFNKWAnd with his Irishman's sense of the tragic, she also knew he felt something about such emptiness.XYFNKWNot pity.XYFNKWThat was not what he was about.XYFNKWSadness, maybe..As Francesca removed the Iowa liquor seal from the top of the brandy bottle, she looked at her fingernails and wished they were longer and better cared for.XYFNKWFarm life did not permit long fingernails.XYFNKWUntil now, it hadn't mattered..Brandy, two glasses, on the table.XYFNKWWhile she arranged the coffee, he opened the bottle and poured just the right amount into each glass.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid had dealt with after-dinner brandy before..She wondered in how many kitchens, how many good restaurants, how many living rooms with subdued light he had practiced that small trade.XYFNKWHow many sets of long fingernails had he watched delicately pointing toward him from the stems of brandy glasses, how many pairs of blue-round and brown-oval eyes had looked at him through evenings, while anchored sailboats rocked offshore and water slapped against the quays of ancient ports?.The overhead kitchen light was too bright for coffee and brandy.XYFNKWFrancesca Johnson, Richard Johnson's wife, would leave it on.XYFNKWFrancesca Johnson, a woman walking through after-supper grass and going through girlhood dreams, would turn it off.XYFNKWA candle was in order, but that would be too much.XYFNKWHe might get the wrong idea.XYFNKWShe put on the small light over the kitchen sink and turned off the overhead.XYFNKWIt was still not perfect, but it was better...He raised his glass to shoulder level and moved it toward her.XYFNKWTo ancient evenings and distant music.XYFNKWFor some reason those words made her take a short, quick breath.XYFNKWBut she touched her glass to his, and even though she wanted to say, To ancient evenings and distant music, she only smiled a little..They both smoked, saying nothing, drinking brandy, drinking coffee.XYFNKWA pheasant called from the fields.XYFNKWJack, the collie, barked twice out in the yard.XYFNKWMosquitoes tested the window screen near the table..It was still hot, no breeze, some humidity now.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid was perspiring mildly, his top two shirt buttons undone.XYFNKWHe was not looking at her directly, though she sensed his peripheral vision could find her, even as he seemed to stare out the window.XYFNKWIn the way he was turned, she could see the top of his chest through the open buttons of his shirt and small beads of moisture lying there upon his skin..Francesca was feeling good feelings, old feelings, poetry and music feelings.XYFNKWStill, it was time for him to go, she thought.XYFNKWNine fifty-two on the clock above the refrigerator..His glass was empty.XYFNKWJust as he swung around from looking out the window, Francesca picked up the brandy bottle by the neck and gestured with it toward the empty glass.XYFNKWHe shook his head.XYFNKWRoseman Bridge at dawn.XYFNKWI'd better get going..She was relieved.XYFNKWBut she sank in disappointment.XYFNKWShe turned around inside of herself.XYFNKWYes, please leave.XYFNKWHave some more brandy.XYFNKWStay.XYFNKWGo.XYFNKWShe didn't know for sure what Robert Kincaid thought...He stood, swung one knapsack onto his left shoulder, put the other on top of his cooler.XYFNKWShe came around the table.XYFNKWHis hand moved toward her, and she took it.XYFNKWThanks for the evening, the supper, the walk.XYFNKWThey were all nice.XYFNKWYou're a good person, Francesca.XYFNKWKeep the brandy toward the front of the cupboard maybe it'll work out after a while...He had known, just as she thought.XYFNKWBut she wasn't offended by his words.XYFNKWHe was talking about romance, and he meant it in the best possible way.XYFNKWShe could tell by the softness of his language, the way he said the words.XYFNKWWhat she didn't know was that he wanted to shout at the kitchen walls: For Christ's sake, Richard Johnson, are you as big a fool as I think you must be?She followed him out to his truck and stood by while he put his gear into it.XYFNKWThe collie came across the yard, sniffing around the truck.XYFNKWJack, come here, she whispered sharply, and the dog moved to sit by her, panting..Good-bye.XYFNKWTake care, he said, stopping by the truck door to look at her for a moment, straight at her.XYFNKWThen, in one motion, he was behind the wheel and shutting the door after him.XYFNKWHe turned the old engine over, stomped at the accelerator, and it rattled into a start.XYFNKWHe leaned out the window, grinning, Tune-up required, I think..He clutched it, backed up, shifted again, and headed across the yard under the light.XYFNKWJust before he reached the darkness of the lane, his left hand came out of the window and waved back at her.XYFNKWShe waved, too, even though she knew he couldn't see it..As the truck moved down the lane, she jogged over and stood in shadow, watching the red lights rising and falling with the bumps.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid turned left on the main road toward Winterset...After he left, Francesca stood before the bureau mirror, naked.XYFNKWHer hips flared only a little from the children, her breasts were still nice and firm, not too large, not too small, belly slightly rounded.XYFNKWShe couldn't see her legs in the mirror, but she knew they were still good...Richard was interested in sex only occasionally, every couple of months, but it was over fast, rudimentary and unmoving, and he didn't seem to care much about perfume or things like that.XYFNKWIt was easy to get a little sloppy..She dressed again and sat at the kitchen table writing on half a sheet of plain paper.XYFNKWJack followed her out to the Ford pickup and jumped in when she opened the door.XYFNKWHe went to the passenger side and stuck his head out the window as she backed the truck out of the shed.XYFNKWShe drove down the lane and turned right onto the county road...Roseman Bridge was dark.XYFNKWBut Jack ran on ahead, checking things out while she carried a flashlight from the truck.XYFNKWShe tacked the note on the left side of the entrance to the bridge and went home...The Bridges of Tuesday..Robert Kincaid drove past Richard Johnson's mailbox an hour before dawn, alternately chewing on a Milky Way and taking bites from an apple, squeezing the coffee cup on the seat between his thighs to keep it from tipping over.XYFNKWHe looked up at the white house standing in thin, late moonlight as he passed and shook his head at the stupidity of men, some men, most men.XYFNKWThey could at least drink the brandy and not bang the screen door on their way out...Francesca heard the out-of-tune pickup go by.XYFNKWShe lay there in bed, having slept naked for the first time as far back as she could remember.XYFNKWShe could imagine Kincaid, hair blowing in the wind, one hand on the wheel, the other holding a Camel...She listened as the sound of his wheels faded toward Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWAnd she began to roll words over in her mind from the Yeats poem: I went out to the hazel wood, because a fire was in my head.He parked the truck well back from the bridge so it wouldn't interfere with his compositions.XYFNKWFrom the small space behind the seat, he took a knee-high pair of rubber boots, sitting on the running board to unlace his leather ones and pull on the others.XYFNKWOne knapsack with straps over both shoulders, tripod slung over his left shoulder by its leather strap, the other knapsack in his right hand, he worked his way down the steep bank toward the stream..The trick would be to put the bridge at an angle for some compositional tension, get a little of the stream at the same time, and miss the graffiti on the walls near the entrance.XYFNKWThe telephone wires in the background were a problem, too, but that could be handled through careful framing..He took out the camera and screwed it onto the heavy tripod.XYFNKWGray light in the east now, and he began to experiment with his composition.XYFNKWMove tripod two feet left, readjust legs sticking in muddy ground by the stream.XYFNKWHe kept the camera strap wound over his left wrist, a practice he always followed when working around water.XYFNKWHe'd seen too many cameras go into the water when tripods tipped over..Red color coming up, sky brightening.XYFNKWLower camera six inches, adjust tripod legs.XYFNKWStill not there.XYFNKWA foot more to the left.XYFNKWAdjust legs again.XYFNKWSun 40 percent above the horizon, old paint on the bridge turning a warm red, just what he wanted..One-second exposure.XYFNKWLook through the viewfinder.XYFNKWFine-tune leveling of camera.XYFNKWHe pushed the plunger of the shutter release and waited for a second to pass..Just as he fired the shutter, something caught his eye.XYFNKWHe looked through the viewfinder again.XYFNKWWhat the hell is hanging by the entrance to the bridge?XYFNKWhe muttered.XYFNKWA piece of paper.XYFNKWWasn't there yesterday..Tripod steady.XYFNKWRun up the bank with sun coming fast behind him.XYFNKWPaper neatly tacked to bridge.XYFNKWPull it off, put tack and paper in vest pocket.XYFNKWBack toward the bank, down it, behind the camera.XYFNKWSun 60 percent up..Breathing hard from the sprint.XYFNKWShoot again.XYFNKWRepeat twice for duplicates.XYFNKWNo wind, grass still..Repeat entire process.XYFNKWCarry tripod and camera to the middle of the stream.XYFNKWGet set up.XYFNKWShoot entire sequence again.XYFNKWNew roll of Kodachrome.XYFNKWSwitch lenses..Flip the camera to vertical, recompose.XYFNKWShoot again.XYFNKWSame sequence, methodical.XYFNKWThere never was anything clumsy about his movements.XYFNKWAll were practiced, all had a reason..Up the bank, through the bridge, running with the equipment, racing the sun.XYFNKWNow the tough one.XYFNKWGrab second camera with faster film, sling both cameras around neck, climb tree behind bridge.XYFNKWScrape arm on bark - Dammit!XYFNKW- keep climbing.XYFNKWHigh up now, looking down on the bridge at an angle with the stream catching sunlight.XYFNKWShoot a dozen more shots...Down the tree.XYFNKWDown the bank.XYFNKWSet up tripod, reload Kodachrome, shoot composition similar to the first series only from the opposite side of the stream.XYFNKWPull third camera out of bag.XYFNKWBlack-and-white work now.XYFNKWLight on bridge changing second by second...After twenty intense minutes of the kind understood only by soldiers, surgeons, and photographers, Robert Kincaid swung his knapsacks into the truck and headed back down the road he had come along before.XYFNKWIt was fifteen minutes to Hogback Bridge northwest of town, and he might just get some shots there if he hurried..Dust flying, Camel lit, truck bouncing, past the white frame house facing north, past Richard Johnson's mailbox.XYFNKWNo sign of her.XYFNKWWhat did you expect?XYFNKWShe's married, doing okay.XYFNKWYou're doing okay.XYFNKWWho needs those kinds of complications?XYFNKWNice evening, nice supper, nice woman.XYFNKWLeave it at that.XYFNKWGod, she's lovely, though, and there's something about her.XYFNKWSomething.XYFNKWI have trouble taking my eyes away from her..Francesca was in the barn doing chores when he barreled past her place.XYFNKWNoise from the livestock cloaked any sound from the road.XYFNKWAnd Robert Kincaid headed for Hogback Bridge, chasing the light..Things went well at the second bridge.XYFNKWIt sat in a valley and still had mist rising around it when he arrived.XYFNKWThe 300-millimeter lens gave him a big sun in the upper-left part of his frame, with the rest taking in the winding white rock road toward the bridge and the bridge itself..Then into his viewfinder came a farmer driving a team of light brown Belgians pulling a wagon along the white road.XYFNKWOne of the last of the old style boys, Kincaid thought, grinning.XYFNKWHe knew when the good ones came by and could already see what the final print would look like as he worked...When he folded up his tripod at eight thirty-five, he felt good.XYFNKWThe one with the farmer and horses might even be a cover shot that's why he had left the space at the top of the frame, room for type, for a logo.XYFNKWEditors liked that kind of thoughtful craftsmanship.XYFNKWThat's why Robert Kincaid got assignments...He had shot all or part of seven rolls of film, emptied the three cameras, and reached into the lower-left pocket of his vest to get the other four.XYFNKWDamn!XYFNKWThe thumbtack pricked his index finger.XYFNKWHe had forgotten about dropping it in the pocket when he'd removed the piece of paper from Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWIn fact, he had forgotten about the piece of paper.XYFNKWHe fished it out, opened it, and read: If you'd like supper again when 'white moths are on the wing,' I come by tonight after you're finished.XYFNKWAnytime is fine..He couldn't help smiling a little, imagining Francesca Johnson with her note and thumbtack driving through the darkness to the bridge.XYFNKWIn five minutes, he was back in town.XYFNKWWhile the Texaco man filled the tank and checked the oil, Kincaid used the pay telephone at the station.XYFNKWThe thin phone book was grimy from being thumbed by filling station hands.XYFNKWThere were two listings under R.XYFNKWJohnson, but one had a town address..He dialed the rural number and waited.XYFNKWFrancesca was feeding the dog on the back porch when the phone rang in the kitchen.XYFNKWShe caught it at the front of the second ring: Johnson's..Hi, this is Robert Kincaid..Her insides jumped again, just as they had yesterday.XYFNKWA little stab of something that started in her chest..Got your note.XYFNKWW.XYFNKWB.XYFNKWYeats as a messenger and all that.XYFNKWI accept the invitation, but it might be late.XYFNKWThe weather's pretty good, so I'm planning on shooting the - let's see, what's it called?XYFNKW- the Cedar Bridge this evening.XYFNKWIt could be after nine before I'm finished.XYFNKWThen I'll want to clean up a bit.XYFNKWSo I might not be there until nine-thirty or ten.XYFNKWIs that all right?No, it wasn't all right.XYFNKWShe didn't want to wait that long, but she only said, Oh, sure.XYFNKWGet your work done that's what's important.XYFNKWI'll fix something that'll be easy to warm up when you get here..Then he added, If you want to come along while I'm shooting, that's fine.XYFNKWIt won't bother me.XYFNKWI could stop by for you about five-thirty..Francesca's mind worked the problem.XYFNKWShe wanted to go with him.XYFNKWBut what if someone saw her?XYFNKWWhat could she say to Richard if he found out?Cedar Bridge was fifty yards upstream from and parallel to the new road and its concrete bridge.XYFNKWShe wouldn't be too noticeable.XYFNKWOr would she?XYFNKWIn less than two seconds, she decided.XYFNKWYes, I'd like that.XYFNKWBut I'll drive my pickup and meet you there.XYFNKWWhat time?About six.XYFNKWI'll see you then.XYFNKWOkay?XYFNKWBye..He spent the rest of the day at the local newspaper office looking through old editions.XYFNKWIt was a pretty town, with a nice square, and he sat there on a bench in the shade at lunch with a small sack of fruit and some bread, along with a Coke from a cafe across the street..When he had walked in the cafe and asked for a Coke to take out, it was a little after noon.XYFNKWLike an old Wild West saloon when the regional gunfighter appeared, the busy conversation had stopped for a moment while they all looked him over.XYFNKWHe hated that, felt self-conscious but it was the standard procedure in small towns.XYFNKWSomeone new!XYFNKWSomeone different!XYFNKWWho is he?XYFNKWWhat's he doing here?.Somebody said he's a photographer.XYFNKWSaid they saw him out by Hogback Bridge this morning with all sorts of cameras..Sign on his truck says he's from Washington, out west...Been over to the newspaper office all morning.XYFNKWJim says he's looking through the papers for information on the covered bridges..Yeah, young Fischer at the Texaco said he stopped in yesterday and asked directions to all the covered bridges..What's he wanna know about them for, anyway?And why in the world would anybody wanna take pictures of 'em?XYFNKWThey're just all failin' down in bad shape..Sure does have long hair.XYFNKWLooks like one of them Beatle fellows, or what is it they been callin' some of them other people?XYFNKWHippies, ain't that it?XYFNKWThat brought laughter in the back booth and to the table next to it..Kincaid got his Coke and left, the eyes still on him as he went out the door.XYFNKWMaybe he'd made a mistake in inviting Francesca, for her sake, not his.XYFNKWIf someone saw her at Cedar Bridge, word would hit the cafe next morning at breakfast, relayed by young Fischer at the Texaco station..He'd learned never to underestimate the telecommunicative flash of trivial news in small towns.XYFNKWTwo million children could be dying of hunger in the Sudan, and that wouldn't worry anybody.XYFNKWBut Richard Johnson's wife seen with a longhaired stranger - now that was news!XYFNKWNews to be passed around, news to be chewed on..He finished his lunch and walked over to the public phone on the parking of the courthouse.XYFNKWDialed her number.XYFNKWShe answered, slightly breathless, on the third ring.XYFNKWHi, it's Robert Kincaid again..Her stomach tightened instantly as she thought, He can't come he's called to say that...Let me be direct.XYFNKWIf it's a problem for you to come out with me tonight, given the curiosity of small-town people, don't feel pressured to do it.XYFNKWFrankly, I could care less what they think of me around here, and one way or the other, I'll come by later.XYFNKWWhat I'm trying to say is that I might have made an error in inviting you, so don't feel compelled in any way to do it.XYFNKWThough I'd love to have you along...She'd been thinking about just that since they'd talked earlier.XYFNKWBut she had decided.XYFNKWNo, I'd like to see you do your work.XYFNKWI'm not worried about talk.XYFNKWShe was worried, but something in her had taken hold, something to do with risk.XYFNKWWhatever the cost she was going out to Cedar Bridge..Great.XYFNKWJust thought I'd check.XYFNKWSee you later..Okay.XYFNKWHe was sensitive, but she already knew that..At four o'clock, he stopped by his motel and did some laundry in the sink, put on a clean shirt, and tossed a second one in the truck, along with a pair of khaki slacks and brown sandals he'd picked up in India.XYFNKWAt a tavern, he purchased two, six packs of Budweiser..Hot, real hot again.XYFNKWThe tavern had been dark and passably cool, with the front door open and big fans on the ceiling and one on a stand by the door whirring at about a hundred and five decibels.XYFNKWSomehow, though, the noise of the fans, the smell of stale beer and smoke, the blare of the jukebox, and the semi-hostile faces staring at him from along the bar made it seem hotter than it really was...Out on the road the sunlight almost hurt.XYFNKWFrancesca Johnson looked cool, though.XYFNKWShe was leaning against the fender of her Ford pickup where she had parked it behind some trees near the bridge.XYFNKWShe had on the same jeans that fit her so well, sandals, and a white cotton T-shirt that did nice things for her body.XYFNKWHe waved as he pulled up next to her truck...Hi.XYFNKWNice to see you.XYFNKWPretty hot, he said.XYFNKWHarmless talk, around-the-edges-of-things talk.XYFNKWThat old uneasiness again, just being in the presence of a woman for whom he felt something.XYFNKWHe never knew quite what to say, unless the talk was serious.XYFNKWEven though his sense of humor was well developed, he had a fundamentally serious mind and took things seriously.XYFNKWHis mother had always said he was an adult at four years of age.XYFNKWThat served him well as a professional.XYFNKWTo his way of thinking, though, it did not serve him well around women such as Francesca Johnson..I wanted to watch you make your pictures.XYFNKW'Shoot,' as you call it..Well, you're about to see it, and you'll find it pretty boring.XYFNKWAt least other people generally do.XYFNKWIt's not like listening to someone practice the piano, where you can be part of it.XYFNKWIn photography, production and performance are separated by a long time span.XYFNKWToday I'm doing production.XYFNKWWhen the pictures appear somewhere, that's the performance.XYFNKWAll you're going to see is a lot of fiddling around.XYFNKWBut you're more than welcome.XYFNKWIn fact, I'm glad you came..She hung on those last four words.XYFNKWHe needn't have said them.XYFNKWHe could have stopped with welcome, but he didn't.XYFNKWHe was genuinely glad to see her that was clear.XYFNKWShe hoped the fact she was here implied something of the same to him..Can I help you in some way?XYFNKWshe asked as he pulled on his rubber boots..You can carry that blue knapsack.XYFNKWI'll take the brown one and the tripod...So Francesca became a photographer's assistant.XYFNKWHe had been wrong.XYFNKWThere was much to see.XYFNKWThere was a performance of sorts, though he was not aware of it.XYFNKWIt was what she had noticed yesterday and part of what drew her toward him.XYFNKWHis grace, his quick eyes, the muscles along his forearms working...Mostly the way he moved his body.XYFNKWThe men she knew seemed heavy compared to him..It wasn't that he hurried.XYFNKWIn fact, he didn't hurry at all.XYFNKWThere was a gazelle-like quality about him, though she could tell he was strong.XYFNKWMaybe he was more like a leopard than a gazelle.XYFNKWYes.XYFNKWLeopard, that was it.XYFNKWHe was not prey.XYFNKWQuite the reverse, she sensed..Francesca, give me the camera with the blue strap, please..She opened the knapsack, feeling a little overcautious about the expensive equipment he handled so casually, and took out the camera..He was on his knees northeast of the bridge, with the tripod low.XYFNKWHe held out his left hand without taking his eye from the viewfinder, and she gave him the camera..He reached under the tripod head and unscrewed the camera on it, which was replaced by the one she had given him.XYFNKWWhile he fastened on the new one, he turned his head toward her and grinned.XYFNKWThanks, you're a first-class assistant.XYFNKWShe flushed a little..God, what was it about him!XYFNKWWhy can't I just say 'you're welcome'?XYFNKWshe thought.XYFNKWI feel sort of slow around him, though it's nothing he does.XYFNKWIt's me, not him.XYFNKWI'm just not used to being with people whose minds work as fast as his does..He moved into the creek, then up the other bank.XYFNKWShe went through the bridge with the blue knapsack and stood behind him, happy, strangely happy.XYFNKWThere was energy here, a power of some kind in the way he worked.XYFNKWHe didn't just wait for nature, he took it over in a gentle way, shaping it to his vision, making it fit what he saw in his mind...He imposed his will on the Scene, fighting changes in light with different lenses, different films, a filter occasionally.XYFNKWHe didn't just fight back, he dominated, using skill and intellect.XYFNKWFarmers also dominated the land with chemicals and bulldozers.XYFNKWBut Robert Kincaid's way of changing nature was elastic and always left things in their original form when he finished...She looked at the jeans pulling themselves tight around his thigh muscles as he knelt down.XYFNKWAt the faded denim shirt sticking to his back, gray hair over the collar of it.XYFNKWAt how he sat back on his haunches to adjust a piece of equipment, and for the first time in ever so long, she grew wet between her legs just watching someone.XYFNKWWhen she felt it, she looked up at the evening sky and breathed deeply, listening to him quietly curse a filter that wouldn't unscrew from a lens..He crossed the creek again back toward the trucks, sloshing along in his rubber boots.XYFNKWFrancesca went into the covered bridge, and when she came out the other end, he was crouched and pointing a camera toward her.XYFNKWHe fired, cocked the shutter, and fired a second and third time as she walked toward him along the road.XYFNKWShe felt herself grin in mild embarrassment..Don't worry.XYFNKWHe smiled.XYFNKWI won't use those anywhere without your permission.XYFNKWI'm finished here.XYFNKWThink I'll stop by the motel and rinse off a bit before coming out..Well, you can if you want.XYFNKWBut I can spare a towel or a shower or the pump or whatever, she said quietly, earnestly..Okay, you're on.XYFNKWGo ahead.XYFNKWI'll load the equipment in Harry - that's my truck - and be right there...She backed Richard's new Ford out of the trees and took it up on the main road away from the bridge, turned right, and headed toward Winterset, where she cut southwest toward home.XYFNKWThe dust was too thick for her to see if he was following, though once, coming around a curve, she thought she could see his lights a mile back, bouncing along in the truck he called Harry...It must have been him, for she heard his truck coming up the lane just after she arrived.XYFNKWJack barked at first but settled down right away, muttering to himself, Same guy as last night okay, I guess.XYFNKWKincaid stopped for a moment to talk with him..Francesca stepped out of the back porch door.XYFNKWShower?That'd be great.XYFNKWShow me the way..She took him upstairs to the bathroom she had insisted Richard put in when the children were growing up.XYFNKWThat was one of the few demands on which she had stood firm.XYFNKWShe liked long hot baths in the evening, and she wasn't going to deal with teenagers tromping around in her private spaces.XYFNKWRichard used the other bath, said he felt uncomfortable with all the feminine things in hers.XYFNKWToo fussy', were his words..The bath could be reached only through their bedroom.XYFNKWShe opened the door to it and took out an assortment of towels and a washcloth from a cupboard under the sink.XYFNKWUse anything you want.XYFNKWShe smiled while biting her lower lip slightly..I might borrow some shampoo if you can spare it.XYFNKWMine's at the motel..Sure.XYFNKWTake your pick.XYFNKWShe set three different bottles on the counter, each partly used..Thanks.XYFNKWHe tossed his fresh clothes on the bed, and Francesca noted the khakis, white shirt, and sandals.XYFNKWNone of the local men wore sandals.XYFNKWA few of them from town had started wearing Bermuda shorts at the golf course, but not the farmers.XYFNKWAnd sandals never...She went downstairs and heard the shower come on.XYFNKWHe's naked now, she thought, and felt funny in her lower belly...Earlier in the day, after he called, she had driven the forty miles into Des Moines and went to the state liquor store.XYFNKWShe was not experienced in this and asked a clerk about a good wine.XYFNKWHe didn't know any more than she did, which was nothing.XYFNKWSo she looked through the rows of bottles until she came across a label that read Valpolicella.XYFNKWShe remembered that from a long time ago.XYFNKWDry, Italian red wine.XYFNKWShe bought two bottles and another decanter of brandy..Next, she looked for a new summer dress from a shop downtown.XYFNKWShe found one, light pink with thin straps.XYFNKWIt was low-cut in back, the same in front rather dramatically so the tops of her breasts were exposed, and gathered around her waist with a narrow sash.XYFNKWAnd new white sandals, expensive ones, flat-heeled, with delicate handiwork on the straps..In the afternoon, she fixed stuffed peppers, filling them with a mixture of tomato sauce, brown rice, cheese, and chopped parsley.XYFNKWThen came a simple spinach salad, corn bread, and an applesauce souffle for dessert.XYFNKWAll of it, except the souffle, went into the refrigerator..She hurried to shorten her dress to knee length.XYFNKWThe Des Moines Register had carried an article earlier in the summer saying that was the preferred length this year.XYFNKWShe always had thought fashion and all it implied pretty weird, people behaving sheep-like in the service of European designers.XYFNKWBut the length suited her, so that's where the hem went...The wine was a problem.XYFNKWPeople around here kept it in the refrigerator, though in Italy they never had done that.XYFNKWYet it was too warm just to let it sit on the counter.XYFNKWThen she remembered the springhouse.XYFNKWIt was about sixty degrees in there in the summer, so she put the wine along the wall...The shower shut off upstairs just as the phone rang.XYFNKWIt was Richard, calling from Illinois..Everything okay?Yes..Carolyn's steer'll be judged on Wednesday.XYFNKWSome other things we want to see next day.XYFNKWBe home Friday, late..All right, have a good time and drive carefully..Frannie, you sure you're okay?XYFNKWSound a little strange..No, I'm fine.XYFNKWJust hot.XYFNKWI'll be better after my bath..Okay.XYFNKWSay hello to Jack for me..Yes, I'll do that.XYFNKWShe glanced at Jack sprawled on the cement of the back porch floor..Robert Kincaid came down the stairs and into the kitchen.XYFNKWWhite button-down-collar shirt, sleeves rolled up to just above the elbow, light khaki slacks, brown sandals, silver bracelet, top two buttons of his shirt open, silver chain.XYFNKWHis hair was still damp and brushed neatly, with a part in the middle.XYFNKWAnd she marveled at the sandals..I'll just take my field duds out to the truck and bring in the gear for a little cleaning..Go ahead.XYFNKWI'm going to take a bath..Want a beer with your bath?If you have an extra one...He brought in the cooler first, lifted out a beer for her, and opened it, while she found two tall glasses that would serve as mugs.XYFNKWWhen he went back to the truck for the cameras, she took her beer and went upstairs, noted that he had cleaned the tub, and then ran a high, warm bath for herself, settling in with her glass on the floor beside her.XYFNKWHe had been here just a few minutes before she was lying where the water had run down his body, and she found that intensely erotic.XYFNKWAlmost everything about Robert Kincaid had begun to seem erotic to her...Something as simple as a cold glass of beer at bath time felt so elegant.XYFNKWWhy didn't she and Richard live this way?XYFNKWPart of it, she knew, was the inertia of long custom.XYFNKWAnd it is typical of all marriages, all relationships.XYFNKWCustom brings predictability, and predictability carries its own comforts she was aware of that, too..And there was the farm.XYFNKWLike a demanding invalid, it needed constant attention, even though the constant change of equipment for human labor had made much of the work less difficult than it had been in the past..But there was something more going on here.XYFNKWPredictability is one thing, fear of change is something else.XYFNKWAnd Richard was afraid of change, any kind of change, in their marriage.XYFNKWDidn't want to talk about it in general.XYFNKWDidn't want to talk about sex in particular.XYFNKWEroticism was, in some way, dangerous business, indecent to his way of thinking..But he wasn't alone and really wasn't to blame.XYFNKWWhat was the barrier to freedom that had been erected out here?XYFNKWNot just on their farm, but in the rural culture.XYFNKWMaybe urban culture, for that matter.XYFNKWWhy the walls and the fences preventing open, natural relationships between men and women?XYFNKWWhy the lack of intimacy, the absence of eroticism?The women's magazines talked about these matters.XYFNKWAnd women were starting to have greater expectations about their place in life in general, as well as what happened in their bedroom lives.XYFNKWMen such as Richard - most men, she guessed - were threatened by these expectations.XYFNKWIn a way, women were asking for men to be poets and passionate lovers at the same time...Women saw no contradiction in that.XYFNKWMen did.XYFNKWThe locker rooms and stag parties and pool halls and segregated gatherings of their lives defined a certain set of male characteristics in which poetry, or anything of subtlety, had no place.XYFNKWSo the clever dance that held them apart went on, while women sighed and turned their faces to the wall in the nights of Madison County...There was something in the mind of Robert Kincaid that understood all of this.XYFNKWShe was sure of that..Walking into the bedroom, toweling off, she noted it was a little after ten.XYFNKWStill hot, but the bath had cooled her.XYFNKWFrom the closet, she took the new dress..She pulled her long black hair behind her and fastened it with a silver clasp.XYFNKWSilver earrings, large hooped ones, and a loose-fitting silver bracelet she also had bought in Des Moines that morning..The Wind Song perfume again.XYFNKWA little lipstick on the high cheek-boned face, the shade of pink even lighter than the dress.XYFNKWHer tan from working outdoors in shorts and midriff tops' accented the whole outfit.XYFNKWHer slim legs came out from under the hem looking just fine..She turned first one way, then the other, looking at herself in the bureau mirror.XYFNKWThat's about as good as I can do, she thought.XYFNKWAnd then, pleased, said half out loud, It's pretty good, though..Robert Kincaid was working on his second beer and repacking the cameras when she came into the kitchen.XYFNKWHe looked up at her..Jesus, he said softly.XYFNKWAll of the feelings, all of the searching and reflecting, a lifetime of feeling and searching and reflecting, came together at that moment.XYFNKWAnd he fell in love with Francesca Johnson, farmer's wife, of Madison County, Iowa, long ago from Naples...I mean, - his voice was a little shaky, a little rough, if you don't mind my boldness, you look stunning.XYFNKWI'm serious.XYFNKWYou're big-time elegant, Francesca, in the purest sense of that word...His admiration was genuine, she could tell.XYFNKWShe reveled in it, bathed in it, let it go into the pores of her skin like soft oil from the hands of some deity who had left her years ago and had now returned..And, in the catch of that moment, she fell in love with Robert Kincaid, photographer-writer, from Bellingham, Washington, who drove an old pickup truck named Harry....Room to Dance Again..On that Tuesday evening in August of 1965, Robert Kincaid looked steadily at Francesca Johnson.XYFNKWShe looked back in kind.XYFNKWFrom ten feet apart they were locked in to one another, solidly, intimately..The telephone rang.XYFNKWStill looking at him, she did not move on the first ring, or the second.XYFNKWIn the long silence after the second ring, and before the third, he took a deep breath and looked down at his camera bags.XYFNKWWith that, she was able to move across the kitchen toward the phone hanging on the wall just behind his chair..Johnson's Hi, Marge.XYFNKWYes, I'm fine.XYFNKWThursday night?XYFNKWShe calculated: He said he'd be here a week, he came yesterday, this is only Tuesday.XYFNKWThe decision to lie was an easy one..She was standing by the door to the porch, phone in her left hand.XYFNKWHe sat within touching distance, his back to her.XYFNKWShe reached out with her right hand and rested it on his shoulder, in the casual way that some women have with men they care for.XYFNKWIn only twenty-four hours, she had come to care for Robert Kincaid..Oh, Marge, I'm tied up then.XYFNKWI'm going shopping in Des Moines.XYFNKWGood chance to get a lot of things done I've been putting off.XYFNKWYou know, with Richard and the kids gone..Her hand lay quietly upon him.XYFNKWShe could feel the muscle running from his neck along his shoulder, just back of his collarbone.XYFNKWShe was looking down on the thick gray hair, neatly parted.XYFNKWMarge babbled on..Yes, Richard called a little while ago.XYFNKWNo, the judging's not till Wednesday, tomorrow.XYFNKWRichard said it'd be late Friday before they're home.XYFNKWSomething they want to see on Thursday.XYFNKWIt's a long drive, particularly in the stock truck.XYFNKWNo, football practice doesn't start for another week.XYFNKWUh-huh, a week.XYFNKWAt least that's what Michael said..She was conscious of how warm his body felt through the shirt.XYFNKWThe warmth came into her hand, moved up her arm, and from there spread through her to wherever it wanted to go, with no effort - indeed, with no control - from her.XYFNKWHe was still, not wanting to make any noise that might cause Marge to wonder.XYFNKWFrancesca understood this..Oh, yes, that was a man asking directions.XYFNKWAs she guessed, Floyd Clark had gone right home and told his wife about the green pickup he had seen in the Johnsons' yard on his way by yesterday..A photographer?XYFNKWGosh, I don't know.XYFNKWI didn't pay much attention.XYFNKWCould have been.XYFNKWThe lies were coming easier now..He was looking for Roseman Bridge Is that right?XYFNKWTaking pictures of the old bridges, huh?XYFNKWOh, well, that's harmless enough...Hippie?XYFNKWFrancesca giggled and watched Kincaid's head shake slowly back and forth.XYFNKWWell, I'm not sure what a hippie looks like.XYFNKWThis fellow was polite.XYFNKWHe only stayed a minute or two and then was gone.XYFNKWI don't know whether they have hippies in Italy, Marge.XYFNKWI haven't been there for eight years.XYFNKWBesides, like I said, I'm not sure I'd know a hippie if I saw one...Marge was talking on about free love and drugs she'd read about somewhere.XYFNKWMarge, I was just getting ready to step into my bath when you called, so I'd better run before the water gets cold.XYFNKWOkay, I'll call soon.XYFNKWBye..She disliked removing her hand from his shoulder, but there was no good excuse not to remove it.XYFNKWSo she walked to the sink and turned on the radio.XYFNKWMore country music.XYFNKWShe adjusted the dial until the sound of a big band came on and left it there..'Tangerine,' he said..What?The song.XYFNKWIt's called 'Tangerine.' It's about an Argentinian woman.XYFNKWTalking around the edges of things again.XYFNKWSaying anything, anything.XYFNKWFighting for time and the sense of it all, hearing somewhere back in his mind the faint click of a door shutting behind two people in an Iowa kitchen..She smiled softly at him.XYFNKWAre you hungry?XYFNKWI have supper ready whenever you want..It was a long, good day.XYFNKWI wouldn't mind another beer before I eat.XYFNKWWill you have one with me?XYFNKWShe would.XYFNKWHe opened two and set one on her side of the table..Francesca was pleased with how she looked and how she felt.XYFNKWFeminine.XYFNKWThat's how she felt.XYFNKWLight and warm and feminine.XYFNKWShe sat on the kitchen chair, crossed her legs, and the hem of her skirt rode up well above her right knee.XYFNKWKincaid was leaning against the refrigerator, arms folded across his chest, Budweiser in his right hand.XYFNKWShe was pleased that he noticed her legs, and he did..He noticed all of her.XYFNKWHe could have walked out on this earlier, could still walk.XYFNKWRationality shouted at him.XYFNKWLet it go, Kincaid, get back on the road.XYFNKWShoot the bridges, go to India.XYFNKWStop in Bangkok on the way and look up the silk merchant's daughter who knows every ecstatic secret.XYFNKWSwim naked with her at dawn in jungle pools and listen to her scream as you turn her inside out at twilight.XYFNKWLet go of this, the voice was hissing now, it's outrunning you..But the slow street tango had begun.XYFNKWSomewhere it played he could hear it, an old accordion.XYFNKWIt was far back, or far ahead, he couldn't be sure.XYFNKWYet it moved toward him steadily.XYFNKWAnd the sound of it blurred his criteria and funneled down his alternatives toward unity.XYFNKWAnd there was nowhere left to go, except toward Francesca Johnson..We could dance, if you like.XYFNKWThe music's pretty good for it, he said in that serious, shy way of his.XYFNKWThen he quickly tacked on his caveat: I'm not much of a dancer, but if you'd like to, I can probably handle it in a kitchen..Jack scratched at the porch door, wanting in.XYFNKWHe could stay out..Francesca blushed only a little.XYFNKWOkay.XYFNKWBut I don't dance much, either anymore.XYFNKWI did as a young girl in Italy, but now it's just pretty much on New Year's Eve, and then only a little bit...He smiled and put his beer on the counter.XYFNKWShe rose, and they moved toward each other.XYFNKWIt's your Tuesday night dance party from WGN, Chicago, said the smooth baritone.XYFNKWWe'll be back after these messages...They both laughed.XYFNKWTelephones and commercials.XYFNKWSomething there was that kept inserting reality between them.XYFNKWThey knew it without saying it..But he had reached out and taken her right hand anyway, in his left.XYFNKWHe leaned easily against the counter, legs crossed at the ankles, right one on top.XYFNKWShe rested beside him, against the sink, and looked out the window near the table, feeling his slim fingers around her hand.XYFNKWThere was no breeze, and the corn was growing..Oh, just a minute.XYFNKWShe reluctantly removed her hand from his and opened the bottom right cupboard.XYFNKWFrom it, she took two white candles she had bought in Des Moines that morning, along with a small brass holder for each candle.XYFNKWShe put them on the table..He walked over, tilted each one, and lit it, while she snapped off the overhead light.XYFNKWIt was dark now, except for the small flames pointing straight upward.XYFNKWThe plain kitchen had never looked this good..The music started again.XYFNKWFortunately, for both of them, it was a slow rendition of Autumn Leaves..She felt awkward.XYFNKWSo did he.XYFNKWBut he took her hand, put an arm around her waist, she moved into him, and the awkwardness vanished.XYFNKWSomehow, it worked in an easy kind of way.XYFNKWHe moved his arm farther around her waist and pulled her closer..She could smell him, clean and soaped and warm.XYFNKWA good, fundamental smell of a civilized man who seemed, in some part of himself, aboriginal..Nice perfume, he said, bringing their hands in to lie upon his chest, near his shoulder..Thank you..They danced, slowly.XYFNKWNot moving very far in any direction.XYFNKWShe could feel his legs against hers, their stomachs touching occasionally..The song ended, but he held on to her, hummed the melody that had just played, and they stayed as they were until the next song began.XYFNKWHe automatically led her into it, and the dance went on, while locusts complained about the coming of September..She could feel the muscles of his shoulder through the light cotton shirt.XYFNKWHe was real, more real than anything she'd ever known.XYFNKWHe bent slightly to put his cheek against hers..During the time they spent together, he once referred to himself as one of the last cowboys.XYFNKWThey had been sitting on the grass by the pump out back.XYFNKWShe didn't understand and asked him about it..There's a certain breed of man that's obsolete, he had said.XYFNKWOr very nearly so.XYFNKWThe world is getting organized, way too organized for me and some others.XYFNKWEverything in its place, a place for everything.XYFNKWWell, my camera equipment is pretty well organized, I admit, but I'm talking about something more than that.XYFNKWRules and regulations and laws and social conventions'.XYFNKWHierarchies of authority, spans of control, long-range plans, and budgets.XYFNKWA world of wrinkled suits and stick-on nametags..Not all men are the same.XYFNKWSome will do okay in the world that's coming.XYFNKWSome, maybe just a few of us, will not.XYFNKWYou can see it in computers and robots and what they bring.XYFNKWIn older worlds, there were things we could do, were designed to do, that nobody or no machine could do.XYFNKWWe run fast, are strong and quick, aggressive and tough.XYFNKWWe were given courage.XYFNKWWe can throw spears long distances and fight in hand-to-hand combat...Eventually, computers and robots will run things.XYFNKWHumans will manage those machines, but that doesn't require courage or strength, or any characteristics like those.XYFNKWIn fact, men are outliving their usefulness.XYFNKWAll you need are sperm banks to keep the species going, and those are coming along now.XYFNKWMost men are rotten lovers, women say, so there's not much loss in replacing sex with science...We're giving up free range, getting organized.XYFNKWEfficiency and effectiveness and all those other things.XYFNKWAnd with the loss of free range, the cowboy disappears, along with the mountain lion and gray wolf.XYFNKWThere's not much room left for travelers..I'm one of the last cowboys.XYFNKWMy job gives me free range of a sort.XYFNKWAs much as you can find nowadays.XYFNKWI'm not sad about it.XYFNKWMaybe a little wistful, I guess.XYFNKWBut it's got to happen it's the only way we'll keep from destroying ourselves..It's probably time to put away the things of childhood and grow up.XYFNKWHell, I recognize it.XYFNKWI admit it.XYFNKWI'm just trying to make some good pictures and get out of fife before I'm totally obsolete or do some serious damage..Over the years, she had thought about what he'd said.XYFNKWIt seemed right to her, somehow, on the surface of it.XYFNKWYet the ways of him contradicted what he said.XYFNKWHe had a certain aggressiveness to him, but he seemed to be able to control it.XYFNKWAnd that's what had both confused and attracted her..On that Tuesday night, they had moved closer and closer together, dancing in the kitchen.XYFNKWFrancesca was pressed close against his chest, and she wondered if he could feel her breasts through the dress and his shirt and was certain he could...He felt so good to her.XYFNKWShe wanted this to run forever.XYFNKWMore old songs, more dancing, more of his body against hers.XYFNKWShe had become a woman again.XYFNKWThere was room to dance again.XYFNKWIn a slow way, she was turning for home, toward a place she'd never been...It was hot.XYFNKWThe humidity was up, and thunder rolled far in the southwest..He was falling into her now.XYFNKWAnd she into him.XYFNKWShe moved her cheek away from his, looked up at him with dark eyes, and he kissed her, and she kissed back, longtime soft kissing, a river of it..They gave up the pretense of dancing, and her arms went around his neck.XYFNKWHis left hand was on her waist behind her back, the other brushing across her neck and her cheek and her hair..Sitting by the window on her sixty-seventh birthday, Francesca watched the rain and remembered.XYFNKWShe carried her brandy into the kitchen and stopped for a moment, staring at the exact spot where the two of them had stood.XYFNKWThe feelings inside of her were overwhelming they always were.XYFNKWAnd they were so strong that she had dared do this in detail only once a year or her mind somehow would have crashed..She tried hard to avoid her recollections.XYFNKWThough in the last few years, the detail was coming back more and more often.XYFNKWShe had ceased trying to stop him from coming into her.XYFNKWThe images were clear, and real, and present.XYFNKWAnd so far back.XYFNKWTwenty-two years back.XYFNKWBut slowly they were becoming her reality once again, the only one in which she cared to live..She knew she was sixty-seven and accepted it, but she could not imagine Robert Kincaid being nearly seventy- five.XYFNKWCould not think of it, could not conceive of it.XYFNKWHe was here with her, right in this kitchen, in his white shirt, long gray hair, khaki slacks, brown sandals, silver bracelet, and silver chain around his neck.XYFNKWHe was here with his arms around her...She finally pulled back from him, from where they stood in the kitchen, and took his hand, leading him toward the stairs, up the stairs, past Carolyn's room, past Michael's room, and into her room, turning on a small reading lamp by the bed...Now, all these years later, Francesca carried her brandy and walked slowly up the stairs, her right hand trailing behind her to bring along the memory of him up the stairs and down the hallway into the bedroom..The physical images were carved in her mind very clearly.XYFNKWShe remembered the clothes coming off and the two of them naked in bed.XYFNKWShe remembered how he held himself just above her and moved his chest slowly against her belly and across her breasts.XYFNKWHow he did this again and again, like some animal courting rite in an old zoology text.XYFNKWAs he moved over her, he alternately kissed her lips or ears or ran his tongue along her neck, licking her as some fine leopard might do in long grass out on the savannah..He was an animal.XYFNKWA graceful, hard, male animal who did nothing openly to dominate her yet dominated her completely, in the exact way she wanted that to happen at this moment..But it was far beyond the physical, though the fact that he could make love for a long time without tiring was part of it.XYFNKWLoving him was - it sounded almost trite to her now, given the attention paid to such matters over the last two decades - spiritual.XYFNKWIt was spiritual, but it wasn't trite..In the midst of it, the lovemaking, she had whispered it to him, put it in one sentence: Robert, you're so powerful it's frightening.XYFNKWHe was powerful physically, but he used his strength carefully.XYFNKWIt was more than that, however..Sex was one thing.XYFNKWIn the time since she'd met him, she had settled into the anticipation - the possibility, anyway - of something pleasurable, a breaking with a routine of sameness.XYFNKWShe hadn't counted on his curious power..It was almost as if he had taken possession of her, in all of her dimensions.XYFNKWThat's what was frightening.XYFNKWShe never had doubted at the beginning that one part of her could remain aloof from whatever she and Robert Kincaid did, the part that belonged to her family and life in Madison County..But he simply took it away, all of it.XYFNKWShe should have known when he first stepped out of his truck to ask directions.XYFNKWHe had seemed shaman-like then, and her original judgment was correct..They would make love for an hour, maybe more, then he would pull slowly away and look at her, lighting a cigarette and one for her.XYFNKWOr sometimes he would just lie beside her, always with one hand moving on her body.XYFNKWThen he was inside her again, whispering soft words into her ear, as he loved her, kissing her between phrases, between words, his arm around her waist, pulling her into him and him into her..And she would begin to turn in her mind, letting him take her where he lived, and he lived in strange, haunted places..With her face buried in his neck and her skin against his, she could smell rivers and wood smoke, could hear steaming trains chuffing out of winter stations, could see travelers in black robes moving steadily along frozen rivers and through summer meadows, beating their way toward the end of things..And she murmured, softly, breathlessly, Oh, Robert Robert I am losing myself...She, who had ceased having orgasms years ago, had them in long sequences now with a half-man, half-something-else creature.XYFNKWShe wondered about him and his endurance, and he told her that he could reach those places in his mind as well as physically, and that the orgasms of the mind had their own special character...She had no idea what he meant.XYFNKWAll she knew was that he had pulled in a tether of some kind and wound it around both of them so tightly she would have suffocated had it not been for the freedom from herself she felt..The night went on, and the great dance continued.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid left only that part of himself that dealt with shape and sound and shadow.XYFNKWAnd he heard the words he whispered to her, as if a voice other than his own were saying them.XYFNKWFragments of a Rilke poem, around the ancient tower I have been circling for a thousand years.XYFNKWThe lines to a Navajo sun chant.XYFNKWHe whispered to her of the visions she brought to him - of blowing sand and brown pelicans riding the backs of dolphins moving north along the coast of Africa..Sounds, small, unintelligible sounds, came from her mouth as she arched herself toward him.XYFNKWBut it was a language he understood completely, and in this woman beneath him, deep inside her, Robert Kincaid's long search came to an end..And he knew finally the meaning of all the small footprints on all the deserted beaches he had ever walked, of all the secret cargoes carried by ships that had never sailed, of all the faces that had watched him pass down winding streets of twilight cities.XYFNKWAnd, like a hunter who has traveled distant miles and now sees the light of his home campfires, his loneliness dissolved.XYFNKWAt last.XYFNKWAt last.XYFNKWHe had come so far so far...Toward morning, he raised himself slightly and said, looking straight into her eyes, This is why I'm here on this planet, at this time, Francesca.XYFNKWNot to travel or make pictures, but to love you.XYFNKWI know that now.XYFNKWI have been falling from the rim of a great, high place, somewhere back in time, for many more years than I have lived in this life.XYFNKWAnd through all of those years, I have been falling toward you...When they came downstairs, the radio was still on.XYFNKWDawn had come up, but the sun lay behind a thin cloud cover..Francesca, I have a favor to ask.XYFNKWHe smiled at her as she fussed with the coffeepot..Yes?XYFNKWShe looked at him.XYFNKWOh, God, I love him so, she thought..Slip on the jeans and T-shirt you wore last night, along with a pair of sandals.XYFNKWNothing else.XYFNKWI want to make a picture of you as you look this morning.XYFNKWA photograph just for the two of us..She went upstairs, her legs weak from being wrapped around him all night, dressed, and went outside with him to the pasture.XYFNKWThat's where he had made the photograph she looked at each year....The Highway and the Peregrine..Robert Kincaid gave up photography for the next few days.XYFNKWAnd except for the necessary chores, which she minimized, Francesca Johnson gave up farm life.XYFNKWThe two of them spent all their time together, either talking or making love.XYFNKWTwice, when she asked, he played the guitar and sang for her in a voice somewhere between fair and good, a little uncomfortable, telling her she was his first audience.XYFNKWWhen he said that, she smiled and kissed him...She rode with him in Harry to the Des Moines airport, where he shipped film to New York.XYFNKWHe always sent the first few rolls ahead, when it was possible, so the editors could look at what he was getting and the technicians could check the quality..Afterward he took her to a fancy restaurant for lunch and held her hands across the table, looking at her in his intense way.XYFNKWAnd the waiter smiled, just watching them, hoping he would feel that way sometime..She wondered at the sense Robert Kincaid had of his ways coming to a close and the ease with which he accepted it.XYFNKWHe could see the approaching death of cowboys and others like them, including himself.XYFNKWAnd she began to understand what he meant when he said he was at the end of a branch of evolution and that it was a dead end..On Thursday, they talked after making love in the afternoon.XYFNKWBoth of them knew this conversation had to occur.XYFNKWBoth of them had been avoiding it..What are we going to do?XYFNKWhe said..She was silent, torn-apart silent.XYFNKWThen, I don't know, softly...Look, I'll stay here if you want, or in town, or wherever.XYFNKWWhen your family comes home, I'll simply talk with your husband and explain how it lies.XYFNKWIt won't be easy, but I'll get it done...She shook her head.XYFNKWRichard could never get his arms around this he doesn't think in these terms.XYFNKWHe doesn't understand magic and passion and all those other things we talk about and experience, and he never will.XYFNKWThat doesn't necessarily make him an inferior person.XYFNKWIt's just too far removed from anything he's ever felt or thought about.XYFNKWHe has no way of dealing with it..Are we going to let all of this go, then?XYFNKWHe was serious, not smiling..I don't know that, either.XYFNKWRobert, in a curious way, you own me.XYFNKWI didn't want to be owned, didn't need it, and I know you didn't intend that, but that's what has happened.XYFNKWI'm no longer sitting next to you, here on the grass.XYFNKWYou have me inside of you as a willing prisoner..He replied, I'm not sure you're inside of me, or that I am inside of you, or that I own you.XYFNKWAt least I don't want to own you.XYFNKWI think we're both inside of another being we have created called 'us.'.Well, we're really not inside of that being.XYFNKWWe are that being.XYFNKWWe have both lost ourselves and created something else, something that exists only as an interlacing of the two of us.XYFNKWChrist, we're in love.XYFNKWAs deeply, as profoundly, as it's possible to be in love...Come travel with me, Francesca.XYFNKWThat's not a problem.XYFNKWWe'll make love in desert sand and drink brandy on balconies in Mombasa.XYFNKWI'll show you lion country and an old French city on the Bay of Bengal where there's a wonderful rooftop restaurant, and trains that climb through mountain passes and little inns run by Basques high in the Pyrenees.XYFNKWIn a tiger preserve in south India, there's a special place on an island in the middle of a huge lake.XYFNKWIf you don't like the road, I'll set up shop somewhere and shoot local stuff or portraits or whatever it takes to keep us going...Robert, when we were making love last night, you said something that I still remember.XYFNKWI kept whispering to you about your power - and, my God, you have that.XYFNKWYou said, 'I am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea.' You were right.XYFNKWThat's what you feel you feel the road inside of you.XYFNKWNo, more than that, in a way that I'm not certain I can explain, you are the road..You're old knapsacks and a truck named Harry and jet airplanes to Asia.XYFNKWAnd that's what I want you to be.XYFNKWIf your evolutionary branch is a dead end, as you say it is, then I want you to hit that end at full speed.XYFNKWI'm not sure you can do that with me along.XYFNKWDon't you see, I love you so much that I cannot think of restraining you for a moment.XYFNKWTo do that would be to kill the wild, magnificent animal that is you, and the power would die with it..He started to speak, but Francesca stopped him...Robert, I'm not quite finished.XYFNKWIf you took me in your arms and carried me to your truck and forced me to go with you, I wouldn't murmur a complaint.XYFNKWYou could do the same thing just by talking to me.XYFNKWBut I don't think you will.XYFNKWYou're too sensitive, too aware of my feelings, for that.XYFNKWAnd I have feelings of responsibility here...Yes, it's boring in its way.XYFNKWMy life, that is.XYFNKWIt lacks romance, eroticism, dancing in the kitchen to candlelight, and the wonderful feel of a man who knows how to love a woman.XYFNKWMost of all, it lacks you.XYFNKWBut there's this damn sense of responsibility I have.XYFNKWTo Richard, to the children.XYFNKWJust my leaving, taking away my physical presence, would be hard enough for Richard.XYFNKWThat alone might destroy him..On top of that, and this is even worse, he would have to live the rest of his life with the whispers of the people here.XYFNKW'That's Richard Johnson.XYFNKWHis hot little Italian wife ran off with some long-haired photographer a few years back.' Richard would have to suffer that, and the children would hear the snickering of Winterset for as long as they live here.XYFNKWThey would suffer, too.XYFNKWAnd they would hate me for it..As much as I want you and want to be with you and part of you, I can't tear myself away from the realness of my responsibilities.XYFNKWIf you force me, physically or mentally, to go with you, as I said earlier, I cannot fight that.XYFNKWI don't have the strength, given my feelings for you..But please don't make me.XYFNKWDon't make me give this up, my responsibilities.XYFNKWI cannot do that and live with the thought of it.XYFNKWIf I did leave now, those thoughts would turn me into something other than the woman you have come to love..Robert Kincaid was silent.XYFNKWHe knew what she was saying about the road and responsibilities and how the guilt could transform her.XYFNKWHe knew she was right, in a way.XYFNKWLooking out the window, he fought within himself, fought to understand her feelings.XYFNKWShe began to cry..Then they held each other for a long time.XYFNKWAnd he whispered to her, I have one thing to say, one thing only I'll never say it another time, to anyone..They made love again that night, Thursday night, lying together until well after sunrise, touching and whispering.XYFNKWFrancesca slept a little then, and when she awoke, the sun was high and already hot.XYFNKWShe heard one of Harry's doors creaking and threw on some clothes..He had made coffee and was sitting at the kitchen table, smoking, when she got there.XYFNKWHe grinned at her.XYFNKWShe moved across the room and buried her face in his neck, her hands in his hair, his arms around her waist.XYFNKWHe turned her around and sat her on his lap, touching her..Finally he stood.XYFNKWHe had his old jeans on, with orange suspenders running over a clean khaki shirt, his boots were laced tight, the Swiss Army knife was on his belt.XYFNKWHis photo vest hung from the back of the chair.XYFNKWThe cowboy was saddled up..I'd better be going..She nodded, beginning to cry.XYFNKWShe saw the tears in his eyes, but he kept smiling that little smile of his..Is it okay if I write you sometime?XYFNKWI want to at least send a photo or two..It's all right, Francesca said, wiping her eyes on the towel hanging from the cupboard door.XYFNKWI'll make some excuse for getting mail from a hippie photographer, as long as it's not too much..You have my Washington address and phone, right?XYFNKWShe nodded.XYFNKWIf I'm not there, call the National Geographic offices.XYFNKWHere, I'll write the number down for you.XYFNKWHe wrote on the pad by the phone, tore off the sheet, and handed it to her..Or you can always find the number in the magazine.XYFNKWAsk for the editorial offices.XYFNKWThey know where I am most of the time...Don't hesitate if you want to see me, or just to talk.XYFNKWAnd I'll be around here for a few more days.XYFNKWThink about what I've said.XYFNKWI can be here, settle the matter in short order, and we could drive northwest together...Francesca said nothing.XYFNKWShe knew he could, indeed, settle the matter in short order.XYFNKWRichard was five years younger than him, but no match intellectually or physically for Robert Kincaid..He slipped into his vest.XYFNKWDon't leave, Robert Kincaid, she could hear herself crying out from somewhere inside..Taking her hand, he walked through the back door toward the truck.XYFNKWHe opened the driver's door, put his foot on the running board, then stepped off it and held her again for several minutes.XYFNKWNeither of them spoke they simply stood there, sending, receiving, remembering the feel of each on the other.XYFNKWReaffirming the existence of that special being, he had talked about..For the last time, he let her go and stepped into the truck, sitting there with the door open.XYFNKWTears running down his cheeks.XYFNKWTears running down her cheeks.XYFNKWSlowly he pulled the door shut.XYFNKWHarry was reluctant to start, as usual, but she could hear his boot hitting the accelerator, and the old truck eventually relented..Robert Kincaid waved to her through the open passenger-side window.XYFNKWShe could see the sun flashing off his silver bracelet.XYFNKWThe top two buttons of his shirt were open...He moved into the lane and down it.XYFNKWFrancesca kept wiping her eyes, trying to see.XYFNKWAs she had done the first night they met, she hurried to the head of the lane and watched the old pickup bounce along.XYFNKWAt the end of it, the truck stopped, the driver's door swung open, and he stepped out on the running board.XYFNKWHe could see her a hundred yards back, looking small from this distance...He stood there, with Harry turning over in the heat, and stared.XYFNKWNeither of them moved they already had said goodbye.XYFNKWThey just looked - the Iowa farm wife, the creature at the end of his evolutionary branch, one of the last cowboys.XYFNKWFor thirty seconds he stood there, his photographer's eyes missing nothing, making their own image that he never would lose..He closed the door, ground the gears, and was crying again as he turned left on the county road toward Winterset.XYFNKWHe looked back just before a grove of trees on the northwest edge of the farm would block his view and saw her sitting cross-legged in the dust where the lane began, her head in her hands..Richard and the children arrived in early evening with stories of the fair and a ribbon the steer had won before being sold for slaughter.XYFNKWCarolyn was on the phone immediately.XYFNKWIt was Friday, and Michael took the pickup truck into town for the things that seventeen-year-old boys do on Friday nights - mostly hang around the square and talk or shout at girls going by in cars.XYFNKWRichard turned on the television, telling Francesca how good the corn bread was as he ate a piece with butter and maple syrup...She sat on the front porch swing.XYFNKWRichard came out after his program was finished at ten o'clock.XYFNKWHe sketched and said, Sure is good to be home.XYFNKWThen, looking at her, You okay, Frannie?XYFNKWYou seem a little tired or dreamy or somethin'...Yes, I'm just fine, Richard.XYFNKWIt's good to have you back safe and sound..Well, I'm turnin' in it's been a long week at the fair, and I'm bushed.XYFNKWYou cornin', Frannie?Not for a little bit.XYFNKWIt's kind of nice out here, so I think I'll just sit awhile.XYFNKWShe was tired, but she was also afraid Richard might have sex in mind.XYFNKWShe just couldn't handle that tonight..She could hear him walking around in their bedroom, above where she pushed back and forth on the swing, her bare feet on the porch floor.XYFNKWFrom the back of the house, she could hear Carolyn's radio playing..She avoided going into town for the next few days, aware all the time that Robert Kincaid was only a few miles away.XYFNKWFrankly, she didn't think she could stop herself if she saw him.XYFNKWShe might run to him and say, Now!XYFNKWWe must go now!By Tuesday, the groceries were running low and Richard needed a part for the corn picker he was getting back in shape.XYFNKWThe day was low-slung, steady rain, light fog, cool for August..Richard got his part and had coffee with the other men at the cafe while she shopped for groceries.XYFNKWHe knew her schedule and was waiting out in front of the store when she finished.XYFNKWHe jumped out and helped her load the bags into the Ford pickup, on the seat and around her knees.XYFNKWAnd she thought of tripods and knapsacks..They drove north on U.S.XYFNKWRoute 169, which formed the main street of Winterset.XYFNKWA block south of the Texaco station, she saw Harry rolling away from the pumps', windshield wipers slapping, and out onto the road ahead of them..Their movement brought them up right behind the old pickup, and sitting high in the Ford, she could see a suitcase and guitar case wedged in next to the spare tire lying flat in the truck.XYFNKWThe back window was rain-spattered, but part of his head was visible.XYFNKWHe leaned over as if to get something from the glove box eight days ago, he'd done that and his arm had brushed across her leg.XYFNKWA week ago, she'd been in Des Moines buying a pink dress..That truck's a long way from home, remarked Richard.XYFNKWWashington State.XYFNKWLooks like a woman driving it long hair, anyway.XYFNKWOn second thought, I'll bet it's that photographer they been talkin' about at the cafe..They followed Robert Kincaid a few blocks north to where 169 intersected with 92 running east and west.XYFNKWThey had to stop, with heavy cross traffic in all directions, complicated by the rain and the fog, which had gotten heavier..For maybe twenty seconds they sat there.XYFNKWHe was up ahead, only thirty feet from her.XYFNKWShe could still do it.XYFNKWGet out and run to Harry's right door, climb in over the knapsacks and cooler and tripods..Since Robert Kincaid had driven away from her last Friday, she realized, in spite of how much she thought she'd cared for him then, she had badly underestimated her feelings.XYFNKWThat didn't seem possible, but it was true.XYFNKWShe had begun to understand what he already understood...But she sat frozen by her responsibilities, staring at that back window harder than she had ever looked at anything in her life.XYFNKWHis left signal light came on.XYFNKWIn a moment, he'd be gone.XYFNKWRichard was fiddling with the Ford's radio...She began to see things in slow motion, some curious trick of the mind.XYFNKWHis turn came, and slowly slowly he moved Harry into the intersection - she could visualize his long legs working the clutch and accelerator and the muscles in his right forearm flexing as he shifted gears - turning left now onto 92 toward the Northwest slowly slowly the old pickup came around so slowly it came around through the intersection, putting its nose to the west..Through tears and rain and fog, she could barely make out the faded red paint on the door: Kincaid Photography - Bellingham, Washington..He had lowered his window to help him get through the bad visibility as he turned.XYFNKWHe made the corner, and she could see his hair blowing as he began to accelerate down 92, heading west, rolling up the window as he drove..Oh, Christ - oh, Jesus Christ Almighty no!XYFNKWThe words were inside of her.XYFNKWI was wrong, Robert, I was wrong to stay but I can't go.XYFNKWLet me tell you again why I can't go.XYFNKWTell me again why I should go..And she heard his voice coming back down the highway.XYFNKWIn a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once, and never again, no matter how many lifetimes you live...Richard took the truck across the intersection heading north.XYFNKWShe looked for an instant past his face toward Harry's red taillights moving off into the fog and rain.XYFNKWThe old Chevy pickup looked small beside a huge semitrailer roaring into Winterset, spraying a wave of road water over the last cowboy...Good-bye, Robert Kincaid, she whispered, and began to cry, openly..Richard looked over at her.XYFNKWWhat's wrong, Frannie?XYFNKWWill you please tell me what's wrong with you?Richard, I just need some time to myself.XYFNKWI'll be all right in a few minutes..Richard tuned in the noon livestock reports, looked over at her, and shook his head....Ashes..Night had come to Madison County.XYFNKWIt was 1987, her sixty-seventh birthday.XYFNKWFrancesca had been lying on her bed for two hours.XYFNKWShe could see and touch and smell and hear all of it from twenty-two years ago..She had remembered, then remembered again.XYFNKWThe image of those red taillights moving west along Iowa 92 in the rain and fog had stayed with her for more than two decades.XYFNKWGod, she loved him so.XYFNKWLoved him then, more than she thought possible, loved him now even more.XYFNKWShe would have done anything for him except destroy her family and maybe him as well..She went down the stairs and sat at the old kitchen table with the yellow Formica top.XYFNKWRichard had bought a new one he'd insisted on it.XYFNKWBut she'd also asked that the old one be stored in a shed, and she had wrapped it carefully in plastic before it was put away...I don't see why you're so attached to this old table, anyway, he had complained while helping her move it.XYFNKWAfter Richard died, Michael had brought it back into the house for her and never asked why she wanted it in place of the newer one.XYFNKWHe'd just looked at her in a questioning way.XYFNKWShe'd said nothing...Now she sat at the table.XYFNKWThen, going to the cupboard, she took down two white candles with small brass holders.XYFNKWShe lit the candles and turned on the radio, slowly adjusting the dial until she found some quiet music..She stood by the sink for a long time, her head tilted slightly upward, looking at his face, and whispered, I remember you, Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWMaybe you were the last one.XYFNKWMaybe the cowboys are all close to dying by now..Before Richard died, she had never tried to call Kincaid or to write, either, though she had balanced on the knife-edge of it every day for years.XYFNKWIf she talked to him one more time, she would go to him.XYFNKWIf she wrote him, she knew he would come for her.XYFNKWThat's how close it was.XYFNKWThrough the years, he never called or wrote again, after sending her the one package with the photographs.XYFNKWShe knew he understood how she felt and the complications he could cause in her life..She subscribed to National Geographic in September of 1965.XYFNKWThe article on the covered bridges appeared the following year, and there was Roseman Bridge in warm first light, the morning he had found her note...On the back page of the magazine, the writers and photographers were featured, and occasionally there were photographs of them.XYFNKWHe was there sometimes.XYFNKWThe same long silver hair, the bracelet, jeans or khakis, cameras hanging off his shoulders, the veins standing out on his arms.XYFNKWIn the Kalahari, at the walls of Jaipur in India, in a canoe in Guatemala, in northern Canada.XYFNKWThe road and the cowboy...She clipped these and kept them in the manila envelope with the covered-bridge issue of the magazine, the two photographs, and his letter.XYFNKWShe put the envelope beneath her underwear in the bureau, a place Richard would never look.XYFNKWAnd like some distant observer tracking him through the years, she watched Robert Kincaid grow older..The grin was still there, even the long, lean body with the good muscles.XYFNKWBut she could tell by the lines around his eyes, the slight droop of the strong shoulders, the slowly sagging face.XYFNKWShe could tell.XYFNKWShe had studied that body more closely than anything else in her life, more closely than her own body.XYFNKWAnd his aging made her long even more for him, if that was possible.XYFNKWShe suspected - no, she knew - he was by himself.XYFNKWAnd he was..In the candlelight, at the table, she studied the clippings.XYFNKWHe looked out at her from places far away.XYFNKWShe came to the special picture from a 1967 issue.XYFNKWHe was by a river in East Africa, facing the camera and up close to it, squatting down, getting ready to take a photograph of something..When she had first looked at this clipping, years ago, she could see that the silver chain around his neck now had a small medallion attached to it.XYFNKWMichael was away at college, and when Richard and Carolyn had gone to bed, she got out a powerful magnifying glass Michael had used for his stamp collection when he was young and brought it close to the photo...My God, she breathed.XYFNKWThe medallion said Francesca on it.XYFNKWThat was his one small indiscretion, and she forgave him for it, smiling.XYFNKWIn all of the photos after that, the medallion was always there on the silver chain...After 1975, she never saw him again in the magazine.XYFNKWShe searched every issue but found nothing.XYFNKWHe would have been sixty-two that year..When Richard died in 1979, when the funeral was over and the children had gone back to their own homes, she thought about calling Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWHe would be sixty-six she was fifty-nine.XYFNKWThere was still time, even with the loss of fourteen years.XYFNKWShe thought hard about it for a week and finally took the number off his letterhead and dialed it..Her heart nearly stopped when the phone began to ring.XYFNKWShe heard the receiver being picked up and almost put the phone back on the hook.XYFNKWA woman's voice said, McGregor Insurance.XYFNKWFrancesca asked the secretary if she had dialed the correct number.XYFNKWShe had.XYFNKWFrancesca thanked her and hung up..Next, she tried the Information operator in Bellingham, Washington.XYFNKWNothing listed.XYFNKWShe tried Seattle.XYFNKWNothing.XYFNKWShe asked if they would check the city directories.XYFNKWThey did, and he was not listed.XYFNKWHe could be anywhere, she thought..She remembered the magazine he had said to call there.XYFNKWThe receptionist was polite but new, and had to get someone to help her with the request.XYFNKWFrancesca's call was transferred three times before she talked with an associate editor who had been at the magazine for twenty years.XYFNKWShe asked about Robert Kincaid...Of course, the editor remembered him.XYFNKWTrying to locate him, huh?XYFNKWHe was a hell of a photographer, if you'll excuse the language.XYFNKWHe was snappish, not in a nasty way, but persistent.XYFNKWHe was after art for-art's sake, and that doesn't work very well with our readership.XYFNKWOur readership wants nice pictures, skillful pictures, but nothing too wild...We always said Kincaid was a little strange none of us knew him well outside of the work he did for us.XYFNKWBut he was a pro.XYFNKWWe could send him anywhere, and he'd deliver, even though he disagreed with our editorial decisions most of the time.XYFNKWAs for his whereabouts, I've been checking our files while we talked.XYFNKWHe left the magazine in 1975.XYFNKWThe address and phone number I have are He read off the same information Francesca already had.XYFNKWShe stopped trying after that, mostly because she was afraid of what she might discover..She was thinking more and more about Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWShe was still able to drive well enough, and several times a year she would go to Des Moines and have lunch in the restaurant where he had taken her.XYFNKWOn one of those trips, she bought a leather-bound book of blank pages.XYFNKWAnd on those pages she began recording in neat handwriting the details of her love affair with him and her thoughts about him.XYFNKWIt required nearly three volumes of the notebooks before she was satisfied she had completed her task..Winterset was improving.XYFNKWInteresting young folks were building houses in the hills.XYFNKWThings had loosened up, long hair was no longer cause for stares, though sandals on men were still pretty scarce and poets were few...Yet except for a few women friends, she withdrew completely from the community.XYFNKWPeople remarked about it and how they often would see her standing by Roseman Bridge and sometimes by Cedar Bridge.XYFNKWOld folks frequently become strange, they said...On the second of February 1982, a United Parcel Service truck came up her driveway.XYFNKWShe hadn't ordered anything she could recall.XYFNKWPuzzled, she signed for the package and looked at the address: Francesca Johnson, RR 2, Winterset, Iowa 50273.XYFNKWThe return address was a law firm in Seattle..The package was neatly wrapped.XYFNKWShe placed it on the kitchen table and opened it carefully.XYFNKWInside were three boxes, packed securely in Styrofoam.XYFNKWTaped to the top of one was a small padded envelope.XYFNKWTo another was taped a business envelope addressed to her and carrying the law firm's return address..She removed the tape from the business envelope and opened it, shaking...January 25, 1982.Ms.XYFNKWFrancesca Johnson.RR2.Winterset, IA 50273.Dear Ms.XYFNKWJohnson:.We represent the estate of one Robert L.XYFNKWKincaid, who recently passed away...Francesca laid the letter on the table.XYFNKWOutside, snow blew across the fields of winter.XYFNKWShe read the words once more..We represent the estate of one Robert L.XYFNKWKincaid, who recently passed away.Oh, Robert Robert no.XYFNKWShe said it softly and bowed her head..An hour later, she was able to continue reading.XYFNKWThe straightforward language of the law, the precision of the words, angered her...We represent..An attorney carrying out his duties to a client..But the leopard who came riding in on the tail of a comet, the shaman who was looking for Roseman Bridge on a hot August day, and the man who stood on the running board of a truck named Harry and looked back at her dying in the dust of an Iowa farm lane - where was he in those words?The letter should have been a thousand pages long.XYFNKWIt should have talked about the end of evolutionary chains and the loss of free range, about cowboys struggling to survive...The only will he left was dated July 8, 1967.XYFNKWHis instructions about having the enclosed items delivered to you were explicit.XYFNKWIf you could not be found, the materials were to be incinerated..Also enclosed inside the box marked with the word Letter is a message for you he left with us in 1978.XYFNKWHe sealed the envelope, and it has been left unopened..Mr.XYFNKWKincaid's remains were cremated.XYFNKWAt his request, no marker was placed anywhere.XYFNKWHis ashes were scattered, also at his request, near your home by an associate of ours.XYFNKWI believe the location was called Roseman Bridge..If we may be of further service, please do not hesitate to contact us..Sincerely yours,.Allen B.XYFNKWQuippen, Attorney at Law..She caught her breath, dried her eyes again, and began to examine the remaining contents of the box...She knew what was in the small padded envelope.XYFNKWShe knew it as surely as she knew spring would come again this year.XYFNKWShe opened it carefully and reached in.XYFNKWOut came the silver chain.XYFNKWThe medallion attached to it was scratched and read Francesca.XYFNKWOn the back, in tiny letters, was: If found, please send to Francesca Johnson, RR 2, Winterset, Iowa, USA...His silver bracelet was wrapped in tissue paper at the bottom of the envelope.XYFNKWA slip of paper was included with the bracelet.XYFNKWIt was her handwriting:.If you'd like supper again when white moths are on the wing, come by tonight after you're finished..Her note from the Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWHe'd kept even that for his memories..Then she remembered that was the only thing he had of hers, his only evidence she existed, besides decaying film emulsions.XYFNKWThe little note from Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWIt was stained and curved, as if it had been carried in a billfold for a long time..She wondered how many times he had read it over the years.XYFNKWShe could imagine him holding the note before him in the thin light of a reading lamp on a nonstop jet to somewhere, sitting on the floor of a bamboo hut in tiger country and reading it by flashlight, folding and putting it away on a rainy night in Bellingham, then looking at photographs of a woman leaning against a fence post on a summer morning or coming out of a covered bridge at sundown..The three boxes each contained a camera with a lens attached.XYFNKWThey were battered, scarred.XYFNKWTurning one around, she could read Nikon on the viewfinder and, just to the upper left of the Nikon label, the letter F.XYFNKWIt was the camera she had handed him at Cedar Bridge...Finally, she opened the letter from him.XYFNKWIt was written in longhand on his stationery and dated August 16, 1978....Dear Francesca,.I hope this finds you well.XYFNKWI don't know when you'll receive it.XYFNKWSometime after I'm gone.XYFNKWI'm sixty-five now, and it's been thirteen years ago today that we met when I came up your lane looking for directions..I'm hoping that this package won't upset your life in any way.XYFNKWI just couldn't bear to think of the cameras sitting in a secondhand case in a camera store or in some stranger's hands.XYFNKWThey'll be in pretty rough shape by the time you get them.XYFNKWBut, I have no one else to leave them to, and I apologize for putting you at risk by sending them to you..I was on the road almost constantly from 1965 to 1975.XYFNKWJust to remove the temptation to call you or come for you, a temptation I have virtually every waking moment of my life, I took all of the overseas assignments could find.XYFNKWThere have been times, many of them, when I've said, The hell with it.XYFNKWI'm going to Winterset, Iowa, and, whatever the cost, take Francesca away with me..But I remember your words, and I respect your feelings.XYFNKWMaybe you were right I just don't know.XYFNKWI do know that driving out of your lane that hot Friday morning was the hardest thing I've ever done or will ever do.XYFNKWIn fact, I doubt if few men have ever done anything more difficult than that...I left National Geographic in 1975 and have been devoting my shooting time mostly to things of my own choosing, picking up a little work where I can get it, local or regional stuff that keeps me away only a few days at a time.XYFNKWIt's been tough financially, but I get along.XYFNKWI always do...Oh, yes, I have a dog now, a golden retrieved.XYFNKWI call him Highway, and he travels with me most of the time, head hanging out the window, looking for good shots..In 1972, I fell down a cliff in Maine, and broke my ankle.XYFNKWThe chain and medallion got torn off in the fall.XYFNKWFortunately, they landed close by.XYFNKWI found them again, and a jeweler repaired the chain..I live with dust on my heart.XYFNKWThat's about as well as I can put it.XYFNKWThere were women before you, a few, but none after.XYFNKWI'm just not interested..I once watched a Canada goose whose mate had been shot by hunters.XYFNKWThey mate for life, you know.XYFNKWThe gander circled the pond for days, and more days after that.XYFNKWWhen I last saw him, he was swimming alone, still looking.XYFNKWI suppose that analogy is a little too obvious for literary tastes, but it's pretty much the way I feel..In my imagination, on foggy mornings or afternoons with the sun bouncing off north-west water, I try to think of where you might be in your life and what you might be doing as I'm thinking of you.XYFNKWNothing complicated-going out to your garden, sitting on your front porch swing, standing at the sink in your kitchen.XYFNKWThings like that..I remember everything.XYFNKWHow you smelled, how you tasted like the summer.XYFNKWThe feel of your skin against mine, and the sound of your whispers as I loved you...Robert Penn Warren once used the phrase a world that seems to be God-abandoned.XYFNKWNot bad, pretty close to how I feel some of the time.XYFNKWBut I cannot live that way always.XYFNKWWhen those feelings become too strong, I load Harry and go down the road with Highway for a few days...I don't like feeling sorry for myself.XYFNKWThat's not who lam.XYFNKWAnd most of the time I don't feel that way.XYFNKWInstead, I am grateful for having at least found you.XYFNKWWe could have flashed by one another like two pieces of cosmic dust..To the universe, four days is no different than four billion light years.XYFNKWI try to keep that in mind..But, I am, after all, a man.XYFNKWAnd all the philosophic rationalizations lean conjure up do not keep me from wanting you, every day, every moment, which I can never spend with you, deep within my head..I love you, profoundly and completely.XYFNKWAnd I always will..The last cowboy,.Robert.P.S.XYFNKWI put another new engine in Harry last summer, and he's doing fine...The package arrived five years ago.XYFNKWAnd looking at the contents had become part of her annual birthday ritual.XYFNKWShe kept his cameras, bracelet, and the chain with the medallion in a special chest in the closet.XYFNKWA local carpenter had made the box to her design.XYFNKWPretty fancy box, he had said.XYFNKWFrancesca had only smiled..At the end of her sixty-seventh birthday, when the rain had stopped, Francesca put the manila envelope in the bottom drawer of the roll-top desk.XYFNKWShe had decided to keep it in her safe deposit box at the bank after Richard died but brought it home for a few days each year at this time...Earlier in the afternoon, she had visited Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWNow she walked out on the porch, dried off the swing with a towel, and sat down.XYFNKWIt was cold, but she would stay for a few minutes, as she always did.XYFNKWThen she walked to the yard gate and stood.XYFNKWThen to the head of the lane.XYFNKWTwenty-two years later, she could see him stepping from his truck in the late afternoon, trying to find his way she could see Harry bouncing toward the county road, then stopping, and Robert Kincaid standing on the running board, looking back up the lane....A Letter from Francesca..Francesca Johnson died in January of 1989.XYFNKWShe was sixty- nine years old at the time of her death.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid would have been seventy-six that year.XYFNKWThe cause of death was listed as natural.XYFNKWShe just died, the doctor told Michael and Carolyn.XYFNKWActually, we're a little confused.XYFNKWWe can find no specific cause for her death.XYFNKWA neighbor found her slumped over the kitchen table..In a 1982 letter to her attorney, she had requested that her remains be cremated and her ashes scattered at Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWCremation was an uncommon practice in Madison County and her wish generated considerable discussion at the cafe and the Texaco station.XYFNKWThe procedure itself was not made public..Following the memorial service, Michael and Carolyn drove slowly to Roseman Bridge and carried out Francesca's instructions.XYFNKWThough it was nearby, the bridge had never been special to the Johnson family, and they wondered, and wondered again, why their rather sensible mother would behave in such a strange way and why she had not asked to be buried by their father, as was customary...Following that, Michael and Carolyn began the long process of sorting through the house and brought home the materials from the safe deposit box after they were examined by the local attorney...They divided the materials from the box and began looking through them.XYFNKWThe manila envelope was in Carolyn's stack.XYFNKWShe was puzzled when she opened it and removed the contents.XYFNKWShe read Robert Kincaid's 1965 letter to Francesca.XYFNKWAfter that, she read his 1978 letter, then the 1982 letter from the Seattle attorney.XYFNKWFinally, she studied the magazine clippings..Michael..He caught the mixture of surprise and musing in her voice and looked up immediately.XYFNKWWhat is it?Carolyn had tears in her eyes.XYFNKWMother was in love with a man named Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWHe was a photographer.XYFNKWRemember when we all had to see the copy of National Geographic with the bridge story in it?XYFNKWHe was the one who took the pictures of the bridges here.XYFNKWAnd remember all the kids talking about the strange-looking guy with the cameras back then?XYFNKWThat was him..Michael sat across from her, his tie loosened, collar open.XYFNKWSay that again, slowly.XYFNKWI can't believe I heard you correctly..After reading the letters, Michael searched the downstairs closet, then went upstairs to Francesca's bedroom.XYFNKWHe had never noticed the walnut box before and opened it.XYFNKWHe carried it down to the kitchen table.XYFNKWCarolyn, here are his cameras..Tucked in one end of the box was a sealed envelope with Carolyn or Michael written on it in Francesca's script, and lying between the cameras were three leather-bound notebooks..I'm not sure I'm capable of reading what's in that envelope, said Michael.XYFNKWRead it out loud to me, if you can do it..She opened the envelope and read aloud...January 7, 1987.Dear Carolyn and Michael,.Though I'm feeling just fine, I think it's time for me to get my affairs in order (as they say).XYFNKWThere is something, something very important, you need to know about.XYFNKWThat's why I'm writing this..After looking through the safe deposit box and finding the large manila envelope addressed to me with a 1965 postmark, I'm sure you'll eventually come to this letter.XYFNKWIf possible, please sit at the old kitchen table to read it.XYFNKWYou'll understand that request shortly).It's hard for me to write this to my own children, but l must.XYFNKWThere's something here that's too strong, too beautiful, to die with me.XYFNKWAnd if you are to know who your mother was, all the goods and bad, you need to know what I'm about to say.XYFNKWBrace yourself..As you've already discovered, his name was Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWHe was a photographer, and he was here in 1965 photographing the covered bridges..Remember how excited the town was when the pictures appeared in National Geographic.XYFNKWYou may also recall that I began receiving the magazine about that time.XYFNKWNow you know the reason for my sudden interest in it..Understand, I loved your father in a quiet fashion.XYFNKWI knew it then, I know it now.XYFNKWHe was good to me and gave me the two of you, who I treasure.XYFNKWDon't forget that..But Robert Kincaid was something quite different, like nobody I've ever seen or heard or read about through my entire life.XYFNKWTo make you understand him completely is impossible.XYFNKWMaybe the notebooks and magazine clippings will help, but even those will not be enough...In a way, he was not of this earth.XYFNKWThat's about as clear as I can say it.XYFNKWI've always thought of him as a leopard-like creature who rode in on the tail of a comet.XYFNKWHe somehow coupled enormous passion with warmth and kindness, and there was a vague sense of tragedy about him.XYFNKWHe felt he was becoming obsolete in a world of computers and robots and organized living in general.XYFNKWHe saw himself as one of the last cowboys, as he put it, and called himself old-fangled..The first time I ever saw him was when he stopped and asked directions to Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWThe three of you were at the Illinois State Fair.XYFNKWBelieve me, I was not seeking any adventure.XYFNKWThat was the furthest thing from my mind.XYFNKWBut I looked at him for less than five seconds, and I knew I wanted him..And please don't think of him as some Casanova running around taking advantage of country girls.XYFNKWHe wasn't like that at all.XYFNKWIn fact, he was a little shy, and I had as much to do with what happened as he did.XYFNKWMore, in fact.XYFNKWThe note tucked in with his bracelet is one I posted on Roseman Bridge so he would see it the morning after we first met.XYFNKWAside from his photographs of me, it's the only piece of evidence he had over the years that I actually existed, that I was not just some dream he had..I know children have a tendency to think of their parents as rather asexual, so I hope what I'm going to say won't shock you, and I certainly hope it won't destroy your memory of me...In our old kitchen, Robert and I spent hours together.XYFNKWWe talked and danced by candlelight.XYFNKWAnd, yes, we made love there and in the bedroom and in the pasture grass and just about anywhere else you can think of.XYFNKWIt was incredible, powerful, transcending lovemaking, and it went on for days, almost without stopping...He was like an arrow in his passion.XYFNKWAnd I was overwhelmed by his emotional and physical power.XYFNKWOnce when I whispered that to him, he simply said, I am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea..I checked the dictionary later.XYFNKWThere are some meanings of the word peregrine, and he would have been aware of that'.XYFNKWHe was all of those things - a stranger, a foreigner in the more general sense of the word, a wanderer, and he also was falcon- like, now that I think of it..If not for your father and the two of you, I would have gone anywhere with him, instantly.XYFNKWHe asked me to go, begged me to go.XYFNKWBut I wouldn't, and he was too much of a sensitive and caring person to ever interfere in our lives after that..The paradox is this: If it hadn't been for Robert Kincaid, I'm not sure I could have stayed on the farm all these years.XYFNKWIn four days, he gave me a lifetime, a universe, and made the separate parts of me into a whole.XYFNKWI have never stopped thinking of him, not for a moment.XYFNKWBut it never took away from anything I felt for the two of you or your father.XYFNKWThinking only of myself for a moment, I'm not sure I made the right decision.XYFNKWBut taking the family into account, I'm pretty sure I did..Robert believed the world had become too rational, had stopped trusting in magic.XYFNKWI've often wondered if I was too rational in making my decision...I'm sure you found my burial request incomprehensible, thinking perhaps it was the product of an old woman.XYFNKWAfter reading the 1982 Seattle attorney's letter and my notebooks, you'll understand why I made that request.XYFNKWI gave my family my life I gave Robert Kincaid what was left of me...I think Richard knew there was something in me he could not reach, and I sometimes wonder if he found the manila envelope when I kept it at home in the bureau.XYFNKWJust before he died, I was sitting by him in a Des Moines hospital, and he said this to me: Francesca, I know you had your own dreams, too.XYFNKWI'm sorry I couldn't give them to you.XYFNKWThat was the most touching moment of our lives together..I don't want to make you feel guilt or pity or any of those things.XYFNKWI only want you to know how much I loved Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWI dealt with it day by day, all these years, just as he did..Though we never spoke again to one another, we remained bound together as tightly as it's possible for two people to be bound.XYFNKWI cannot find the words to express this adequately.XYFNKWHe said it best when he told me we had ceased being separate beings and, instead, had become a third being formed by the two of us.XYFNKWNeither of us existed independent of that being.XYFNKWAnd that being was left to wander..Carolyn, remember the horrible argument we had once about the light pink dress in my closet?XYFNKWYou had seen it and wanted to wear it.XYFNKWThat was the dress I wore the first night Robert and I made love.XYFNKWI've never looked as good in my entire life as I did that night.XYFNKWThe dress was my small and foolish memory of that time.XYFNKWThat's why I never wore it again and why I refused to let you wear it..After Robert left here in 1965, I realized I knew very little about him, in terms of his family history.XYFNKWHe was an only child, both his parents were dead, and he was born in a small town in Ohio...I'm not even sure if he went to college or even high school, but he had an intelligence that was brilliant in a raw, primitive, almost mystical fashion.XYFNKWOh yes, he was a combat photographer with the marines in the South Pacific during World War II...He was married once and divorced, a longtime before he met me.XYFNKWThere were no children.XYFNKWHis wife had been a musician of some kind, a folksinger I think he said, and his long absences on photographic expeditions were just too hard on the marriage.XYFNKWHe took the blame for the breakup..Other than that, Robert had no family, as far as I know.XYFNKWI am asking you to make him part of ours, however difficult that may seem to you at first.XYFNKWAt least I had a family.XYFNKWRobert was alone.XYFNKWThat was not fair, and I knew it..I prefer that all of this be kept within the Johnson family, somehow.XYFNKWI'll leave it to your judgment, though..In any case, I'm certainly not ashamed of what Robert Kincaid and I had together.XYFNKWOn the contrary.XYFNKWI loved him desperately throughout all these years, though I tried to contact him only once.XYFNKWThat was after your father died.XYFNKWThe attempt failed, and I was afraid something had happened to him, so I never tried again out of that fear.XYFNKWI simply couldn't face that reality.XYFNKWSo you can imagine how I felt when the package with the attorney's letter arrived in 1982..As I said, I hope you understand and don't think ill of me.XYFNKWIf you love me, then you must love what I have done..Robert Kincaid taught me what it was like to be a woman in a way that few women, maybe none, will ever experience.XYFNKWHe was fine and warm, and he deserves, certainly, your respect and maybe your love.XYFNKWI hope you can give him both of those.XYFNKWIn his own way, through me, he was good to you..Go welt, my children..Mother..There was silence in the old kitchen.XYFNKWMichael took a deep breath and looked out the window.XYFNKWCarolyn looked around her, at the sink, the floor, at the table, at everything...When she spoke, her voice was almost a whisper.XYFNKWOh, Michael, Michael, think of them all those years, wanting each other so desperately.XYFNKWShe gave him up for us and for Dad.XYFNKWAnd Robert Kincaid stayed away out of respect for her feelings about us.XYFNKWMichael, I can hardly deal with the thought of it.XYFNKWWe treat our marriages so casually, and we were part of the reason that an incredible love affair ended the way it did...They had four days together, just four.XYFNKWOut of a lifetime.XYFNKWIt was when we went to that ridiculous state fair in Illinois.XYFNKWLook at the picture of Mom.XYFNKWI never saw her like that.XYFNKWShe's so beautiful, and it's not the photograph.XYFNKWIt's what he did for her.XYFNKWJust look at her she's wild and free.XYFNKWHer hair's blowing in the wind, her face is alive.XYFNKWShe just looks wonderful..Jesus, was all Michael could say, wiping his forehead with the kitchen towel..Carolyn spoke again.XYFNKWApparently he never tried to contact her all these years.XYFNKWAnd he must have died alone that's why he had the cameras sent to her..I remember the fight Mom and I had over the pink dress.XYFNKWIt went on for days.XYFNKWI whined and asked why.XYFNKWThen I refused to speak to her.XYFNKWAll she ever said was, 'No, Carolyn, not that one.'.And Michael remembered the old table at which they were sitting.XYFNKWThat's why Francesca had asked him to bring it back into the kitchen after their father died..Carolyn opened the small padded envelope.XYFNKWHere's his bracelet and his silver chain and medallion.XYFNKWAnd here's the note Mother mentioned in her letter, the one she put on Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWThat's why the photo he sent of the bridge shows the piece of paper tacked to it..Michael, what are we going to do?XYFNKWThink about it for a moment I'll be right back..She ran up the stairs and returned in a few minutes carrying the pink dress folded carefully in plastic.XYFNKWShe shook it out and held it up for Michael to see...Just imagine her wearing this and dancing with him here in the kitchen.XYFNKWThink of all the time we've spent here and the images she must have seen while cooking and sitting here with us, talking about our problems, about where to go to college, about how hard it is to have a successful marriage.XYFNKWGod, we're so innocent and immature compared to her...Michael nodded and turned to the cupboards above the sink.XYFNKWDo you suppose Mother kept anything to drink around here?XYFNKWLord knows I can use it.XYFNKWAnd, to answer your question, I don't know what we're going to do..He rummaged through the cupboards and found a bottle of brandy, almost empty.XYFNKWThere's enough for two drinks here, Carolyn.XYFNKWWant one?Yes...Michael took the only two brandy glasses from the cupboard and set them on the yellow Formica table.XYFNKWHe emptied Francesca's last bottle of brandy into them, while Carolyn silently began reading volume one of the notebooks.XYFNKWRobert Kincaid came to me on the sixteenth of August, a Monday, in 1965.XYFNKWHe was trying to find Roseman Bridge.XYFNKWIt was late afternoon, hot, and he was driving a pickup truck he called Harry...Postscript:.The Tacoma Nighthawk..As I wrote the story of Robert Kincaid and Francesca Johnson, I became more and more intrigued with Kincaid and how little any of us knew about him and his life.XYFNKWOnly a few weeks before the book went to the printers, I flew to Seattle and tried again to find additional information about him...I had an idea that since he liked music, and was an artist himself, there might have been someone in the music and art culture of the Puget Sound area who knew him.XYFNKWThe arts editor of the Seattle Times' was helpful.XYFNKWI got access to pertinent sections of the newspaper from 1975 through 1982, the period in which I was most interested...Finally, I came across a photo of a black jazz musician, a tenor saxophone player named John Nighthawk Cummings.XYFNKWAnd beside the photo was the credit line Robert Kincaid.XYFNKWThe local musicians' union provided me with Cummings's address and told that he had not played actively for some years...It took several visits to his apartment before I found him at home.XYFNKWHe was careful, initially, of my inquiries.XYFNKWBut I convinced him I had a serious and good interest in Kincaid, and he became cordial and open after that.XYFNKWWhat follows is a slightly edited transcript of my interview with Cummings, who was seventy at the time I talked with him.XYFNKWI simply turned on my tape recorder and let him tell me about Robert Kincaid....Interview with Nighthawk Cummings..I was doin' a gig up in Seattle where I was livin' at the time, and I needed a good black-and-white glossy of myself for publicity.XYFNKWThe bass player told me there was a guy livin' out on one of the islands who did some good work.XYFNKWHe didn't have a phone, so I sent him a postcard...He came by, a real strange-lookin' old dude in jeans and boots and orange suspenders, takes out these old beat- up cameras that didn't even look like they'd work, and I thought, Uh-oh.XYFNKWHe put me up against a light-colored wall with my horn and told me to play and keep on playing.XYFNKWSo I played.XYFNKWFor the first three minutes or so, the guy just stood there and looked at me hard, real hard, with the coolest blue eyes you've ever seen..After a little while, he starts takin' pictures.XYFNKWThen he asks if I'll play Autumn Leaves.XYFNKWAnd I do that.XYFNKWI play the tune for maybe ten minutes straight while he keeps banging away with his cameras, takin' one shot after another.XYFNKWThen he says, Fine, I've got it.XYFNKWI'll have them for you tomorrow..Next day he brings them by, and I'm knocked over.XYFNKWI've had a lot of pictures taken of me, but these were the best, by far.XYFNKWHe charged me fifty dollars, which seemed pretty cheap to me.XYFNKWHe thanks me, leaves, and on his way out asks where I'm playin'..A few nights later, I look out at the audience and see him sittin' at a table off in the corner, listenin' real hard.XYFNKWWell, he started cornin' in once a week, always on a Tuesday, always drank beer, but not much of it..I sometimes went over on breaks and talked with him for a few minutes.XYFNKWHe was quiet, didn't say a lot, but real pleasant, always asked politely if I'd mind playin' Autumn Leaves...After a while, we got to know each other a little.XYFNKWI used to like to go down to the harbor and watch the water and ships turns out, so did he.XYFNKWSo we'd sit on a bench for whole afternoons and talk.XYFNKWJust a couple of old guys winding it down, starting to feel a little out of place, a little obsolete...Used to bring his dog along.XYFNKWNice dog.XYFNKWCalled him Highway..He understood magic.XYFNKWJazz musicians understand it, too.XYFNKWThat's probably why we got along.XYFNKWYou're playing some tune you've played a thousand times before, and suddenly there's a whole new set of ideas coming straight out of your horn.XYFNKWHe said photography and life in general were a lot like that.XYFNKWThen he added, So is making love to a woman you love..He was workin' on somethin' where he was tryin' to convert music into visual images.XYFNKWHe said to me, John, you know that riff you almost always play in 'Sophisticated Lady'?XYFNKWWell, I think I got that on film the other morning.XYFNKWThe light came across the water just right and a blue heron kind of looped through my viewfinder all at the same time.XYFNKWI could actually see your riff while I was hearing it and hit the shutter..He spent all his time on this music-into-images thing.XYFNKWWas obsessed by it.XYFNKWDon't know how he made a living..He never said much about his own life.XYFNKWI knew he'd traveled a lot doing photography, but not much more until one day I asked him about the little silver thing he had on a chain around his neck.XYFNKWUp close, I could see the name Francesca on it.XYFNKWSo I asked him, Anything special about that?.He didn't say anything for a while, just stared out at the water.XYFNKWThen he said, How much time do you have?XYFNKWWell, it was a Monday, my night off, so I told him I had as much as it took...He started talkin'.XYFNKWIt was like a faucet got turned on.XYFNKWTalked all afternoon and most of the night.XYFNKWI had the feelin' he'd kept this all inside of him for a long time..Never mentioned the woman's last name, never said where it all took place.XYFNKWThis Robert Kincaid was a poet when he talked about her.XYFNKWShe must've really been something, one incredible lady..And, man, he cried while he talked.XYFNKWHe cried big tears, the kind it takes an old man to cry, the kind it takes a saxophone to play.XYFNKWAfterward, I understood why he always requested Autumn Leaves.XYFNKWAnd, man, I started to love this guy.XYFNKWAnyone who can feel that way about a woman is worth lovin' himself..So I got to thinkin' about it, about the power of this thing he and the woman had.XYFNKWAbout what he called the old ways.XYFNKWAnd I said to myself, I've got to play that passion, that love affair, make those old ways come out of my horn.XYFNKWThere was somethin' so damn lyrical about it..So I wrote this tune - took me three months.XYFNKWI wanted to keep it simple, elegant.XYFNKWComplex things are easy to do.XYFNKWSimplicity's the real challenge.XYFNKWI worked on it every day until I began to get it right.XYFNKWFinally, one night I played it..He was out there in the audience Tuesday night, as usual.XYFNKWAnyway, it's a slow night, maybe twenty people in the place, nobody payin' much attention to the group..He's sittin' there, quietly, listenin' hard like he always did, and I say over the microphone, I'm gonna play a tune I wrote for a friend of mine.XYFNKWIt's called 'Francesca.'..I watched him when I said k.XYFNKWHe's starin' at his bottle of beer, but when I said Francesca, he slowly looked up at me, brushed back his long gray hair with both hands, lit a Camel, and those blue eyes came right at me...I made that horn sound like it never had before I made it cry for all the miles and years that separated them.XYFNKWThere was a little melodic figure that sort of pronounced her name - Fran ces ca..When I finished, he stood real straight by his table, smiled and nodded, paid his bill, and left.XYFNKWAfter that, I always played it when he came by.XYFNKWHe framed a photograph of an old covered bridge and gave it to me for writin' the song.XYFNKWIt's hangin' right over there.XYFNKWNever told me where he took it, but it says Roseman Bridge right below his signature..One Tuesday night, seven, maybe eight years ago, he doesn't show.XYFNKWHe's not there the next week, either.XYFNKWI think maybe he's sick or somethin'.XYFNKWI start to worry, go down to the harbor, ask around.XYFNKWNobody knows nothin' about him.XYFNKWFinally, I take a boat over to the island where he lived.XYFNKWIt was an old cabin - shack, really - down by the water..While I'm walkin' around, a neighbor comes over and asks what I'm doin'.XYFNKWSo I tell him.XYFNKWNeighbor says he died about ten days ago.XYFNKWMan, I hurt when I heard that.XYFNKWStill do.XYFNKWI liked that guy a lot.XYFNKWThere was somethin' about that cat, somethin'.XYFNKWI had the feelin' there were things he knew that the rest of us don't..I asked this neighbor about the dog.XYFNKWHe doesn't know.XYFNKWSaid he didn't know Kincaid, either.XYFNKWSo I call the pound, and sure enough they've got old Highway down there.XYFNKWI go down and get him out and gave him to my nephew.XYFNKWThe last I saw of him, he and the kid were having a love affair.XYFNKWI felt good about that...Anyway, that's about it.XYFNKWNot long after I found out what happened to Kincaid, my left arm started going numb when I play for more than twenty minutes.XYFNKWSo I don't work anymore...But, man, I'm haunted by that story he told me about him and the woman.XYFNKWSo, every Tuesday night I get out my horn, and I play that tune I wrote for him.XYFNKWI play it here, all by myself..And for some reason I always look at that picture he gave me while I play it.XYFNKWSomethin' about it, don't know what it is, but I can't take my eyes off that picture when I play the tune..I just stand here, about twilight, makin' my old horn weep, and I play that tune for a man named Robert Kincaid and a woman he called Francesca....A New School..Parents and grandparents say that the years you spend at school are the best years of your life.XYFNKWMaybe it's true for some young people, but it wasn't like that for me not at the beginning anyway..My name is Alice May and I'm eleven years old.XYFNKWI lived with my family in London until my father got a new job in St Ives.XYFNKWWe moved to beautiful Cornwall one summer..This is my story..The sun shone over St Ives, a seaside town in Cornwall.XYFNKWIt was a busy fishing port.XYFNKWThere were small stone houses and white sandy beaches.XYFNKWLots of families lived there..The town needed a bigger, more important school, so a famous architect designed a secondary school.XYFNKWThe school was for children between the ages of eleven and eighteen.XYFNKWIt was called The Fairbrother Academy..The architect was very clever and he also loved music..'Every school needs a concert hall with a stage and lights,' he said.XYFNKWThe concert hall he created was wonderful.XYFNKWHe also built a large gym, art studios, computer rooms and classrooms that were big and bright..The outside of the school was beautiful.XYFNKWThere was a large front door and lions around a fountain.XYFNKWThere were gardens and playgrounds and birds sang in the trees..Some of the children who came to The Fairbrother Academy didn't want to learn.XYFNKWThey were not interested in French or Latin, Maths or History.XYFNKWThey pushed their classmates in the playground and called them bad names.XYFNKWThese children were good when they were at home with their parents, but terrible when they came to school..I can hardly sleep before the first day at my new school The Fairbrother Academy.XYFNKWI am excited and nervous all at the same time..In the morning, when I walk into my classroom, I see a group of girls.XYFNKWThey are talking together.XYFNKWThey stop speaking when I come in..'Hello,' I say.XYFNKW'I'm Alice.'.The girls don't smile.XYFNKWTheir eyes are cold.XYFNKWOne of the girls called Iris Fudge, who has an angry face, comes close.XYFNKWShe looks at my long dark hair and blue eyes.XYFNKWThen she makes a scary face and runs back to her best friend Roxy Miller and the group of girls..'Don't go near her.XYFNKWShe bites!' Iris says..They won't talk to me because I have braces on my teeth.XYFNKWThey call me 'Shark Face'..I don't look very happy when I arrive home from school.XYFNKWMy parents see my sad face..'How was school?' they ask..'Fine,' I say..They ask me about friends and I tell them about the girls in my class and the fun things we do together.XYFNKWIt isn't true.XYFNKWI can't tell them what school is really like.XYFNKWIf dad speaks to the teachers everything will become worse..Every day there is trouble in our classroom.XYFNKWThe bullies don't like children who are clever and do well at school or children who wear glasses.XYFNKWThey want kids in their group who are not very nice to teachers.XYFNKWThey like children who don't do their homework.XYFNKWThey think only bad children are cool..It isn't only the group of girls who are bullies.XYFNKWThere is a boy gang too.XYFNKWTheir leader is Dexter Crane.XYFNKWHe's very tall.XYFNKWDexter pushes his classmates when they are in the playground.XYFNKWHis friends, Ajax McCoy and Blaze Fenton, watch and laugh.XYFNKWThey stand behind him..At home in our house, a little bird sings in the tree near my bedroom window.XYFNKWShe sees me crying and I tell her what school is like.XYFNKWThe little bird shakes her head.XYFNKWShe doesn't like it at all....CHAPTER TWO..Isadora Sunshine..The little bird flies across the fields, to an old house near the sea.XYFNKWThe windows of the house are open and the little bird flies in and rests on a bookcase.XYFNKWIt is Miss Sunshine's house..Miss Isadora Sunshine has golden hair and bright green eyes.XYFNKWShe is standing in front of a canvas, surrounded by paints and brushes.XYFNKWShe is painting a picture of a storm and sailing boats..She has paint on her face and on her clothes, but the painting is wonderful..When Miss Sunshine sees the little bird fly in, she puts her brush on the table.XYFNKWShe takes some bread and puts it in a dish.XYFNKWShe brings the bird some water..'How lovely to see you,' says Miss Sunshine.XYFNKWShe knows from the way the bird jumps from one foot to the other that she has something important to tell her..'Tell me.XYFNKWWhat's the matter?' she says..Miss Sunshine sits on a chair and the little bird sings a sad song of trouble.XYFNKWWhen she finishes Miss Sunshine stands up..'How sad,' she says.XYFNKW'You were right to tell me.XYFNKWWe can do something to help.'.Miss Sunshine packs a bag with music books, art brushes and strange musical instruments.XYFNKWShe puts her bag in the car and starts the engine..'Hold on tight,' she says to the little bird.XYFNKW'It will only take forty-five minutes to drive to the school.'.She drives to St Ives..Before I continue with the story, I must tell you about the head teacher at The Fairbrother Academy..How can I describe him?XYFNKWHe is not a handsome man.XYFNKWHis face is a bit like your reflection when you look in a kettle - sort of squashed.XYFNKWHe is thin, and has long legs.XYFNKWHis name is James Weak and his name describes his character.XYFNKWHe is weak by name and weak by nature.XYFNKWSome people say he is a good head teacher.XYFNKWOthers say he doesn't answer his emails.XYFNKWHe is busy in his office every day playing scrabble on his computer..On this particular day his secretary, Miss Baxter, knocks on the door.XYFNKW'There's a lady to see you.'.'Oh, really?XYFNKWI wasn't expecting anyone.XYFNKWWhat lady?' says Mr Weak..'Miss Isadora Sunshine.'.Mr Weak looks up because the moment he hears the name 'Sunshine', he begins to feel happy.XYFNKW'Send her in, Miss Baxter.'.Miss Isadora Sunshine is wearing a yellow dress and she smells of sweet flowers.XYFNKWShe shakes Mr Weak's hand and sits down..'I am here for the job of music teacher,' she says..Mr Weak is confused.XYFNKW'Um, I don't think there is a job as music teacher at the school.'.'Yes, there is,' shouts Miss Baxter from her office.XYFNKW'You have an email this morning from the old music teacher', she says.XYFNKWShe appears with a printed letter.XYFNKW'He left yesterday.'.Mr Weak looks even more surprised.XYFNKW'Well, then yes - there is a job at the school.XYFNKWWe are looking for a music teacher.'.'I want good behaviour in the classroom,' says Miss Sunshine..'Of course,' says Mr Weak.XYFNKW'But we are a friendly school, Miss Sunshine.XYFNKWWe allow children to call teachers by their first names.'.Miss Sunshine smiles and shakes her head.XYFNKW'I'm sorry, Mr Weak, but I won't allow that in my classroom.XYFNKWRespect is very important and I am here as their teacher, not as their best friend.'.'I see,' says Mr Weak.XYFNKWHe looks confused.XYFNKW'There may be other candidates,' he says in a voice weak as water..'Mr Weak, there are no other candidates and there is no one better than me.'.Mr Weak looks at Miss Sunshine.XYFNKWHe agrees but he doesn't say anything..'So,' Miss Sunshine says.XYFNKW'If there are no more questions, I would like a copy of my timetable, so that I can start this minute.'...CHAPTER THREE..A Classroom of Sunshine..No one talks to me at school.XYFNKWI feel alone as I stand at the side of the playground.XYFNKWThere are the cool kids and there are the ones people don't speak to - children who are different.XYFNKWI want to speak to them, but I'm afraid of Iris Fudge and her gang..The teachers know there's trouble in our class but they don't see children push their classmates or hear the bad names.XYFNKWThe bullies are clever.XYFNKWSometimes we speak to a teacher, one who has an understanding face..'Write everything down,' the teacher says to us.XYFNKW'I will make a report and pass it on to the head teacher.'.We write a letter but nothing happens.XYFNKWThings are getting worse.XYFNKWThe bullies can contact me in cyberspace at every moment of the day and night.XYFNKWWhy can't they leave me alone!And then Miss Sunshine comes into my life..Children stop talking and texting when she walks into the music room in her yellow dress.XYFNKWHer hair is long and golden.XYFNKWShe ties it with a silk scarf.XYFNKWShe smiles at us and looks at every child..She says, 'Good Morning,' then waits..We look at each other.XYFNKWWhy is she waiting?XYFNKWThen we realise and we stand up.XYFNKWDexter is the last one to stand up.XYFNKWHe doesn't look happy..'No phones during my lesson.' Miss Sunshine has a box and envelopes with our names on.XYFNKWWe don't want to give her our phones.XYFNKWDexter and Ajax are angry..When Miss Sunshine walks past us there is a lovely perfume.XYFNKWIt's the smell of grass and sweet summer flowers.XYFNKWShe asks us our names and doesn't forget them.XYFNKWWhen she gives us our homework we have to say 'thank you.'.It's our first music lesson and Miss Sunshine wants us to speak about music.XYFNKW'What music do you like?'.Roxy stands up.XYFNKW'I hate classical music.'.'Hate is a very strong word, Roxy.XYFNKWWe don't hate anyone or anything.XYFNKWWhy don't you like classical music?'.'There are too many notes,' she says and her friends laugh..'I understand your opinion, Roxy.XYFNKWClassical music is difficult.XYFNKWThere are a lot of notes.'.'I play jazz with my piano teacher,' Roxy says..I can feel surprise in the classroom and I see Miss Sunshine smiling.XYFNKW'Good,' she says..'What about rap music?' Ajax McCoy says.XYFNKW'Now rap music is clever.'.'Why is it clever, Ajax?' Miss Sunshine asks..'Rap artists' songs are like poetry.XYFNKWEach rap song has a message.'.'I like musical theatre,' says Blaze..'I saw the musical Cats once,' says Ajax..'Any other important musicians?' asks Miss Sunshine..Someone says 'The Beatles.' The class says 'No.'.'You're right,' says Miss Sunshine.XYFNKW'The Beatles were important for all the music that came after them.'.'What about Ed Sh-Sh-Sheeran,' says Naomi with a stutter.XYFNKWShe never speaks..'Excellent, Naomi.XYFNKWEd Sheeran was really good at music when he was a small child, like Mozart.XYFNKWHe started singing in his local church at the age of four.'.Everyone is good in that first lesson.XYFNKWIt's the second lesson when it all begins to go wrong....CHAPTER FOUR..Imagine..Miss Sunshine's eyes are cold as she stands in the door of the classroom.XYFNKWA paper aeroplane flies through the air and lands at her feet.XYFNKWDexter pulls a small boy's arm behind his back.XYFNKWTwo other boys are fighting.XYFNKWGirls are shouting.XYFNKWThere's so much noise..Miss Sunshine walks to the teacher's desk, but the noise doesn't stop.XYFNKWShe takes a whistle from her bag and blows it.XYFNKWThe sound makes the whole class stop and look at their teacher..'Good morning,' Miss Sunshine says.XYFNKWShe waits for the class to stand.XYFNKWSome of the boys sit in their chairs.XYFNKWThey are writing texts on their phones or listening to music.XYFNKWBlaze is humming..'I see,' says Miss Sunshine.XYFNKWShe speaks only to the children who are standing.XYFNKW'Can you bring your chairs round the piano?'.I take my chair and sit next to Emma.XYFNKWShe's a sweet girl who works hard.XYFNKWShe's clever and they laugh at her because she wears glasses..I don't know what Miss Sunshine will do about the other children..She takes some paper from her bag and gives a sheet of paper to Dexter, Ajax, Blaze, Roxy and Iris..'I would like you to write me a few paragraphs on The Music I Like,' she says.XYFNKWShe walks away.XYFNKWThey don't say anything..She looks at us and says 'Take a deep breath.'.Someone laughs, but Miss Sunshine closes her eyes for a moment.XYFNKW'Stand up.'.We all stand..'Shoulders down, stand tall, straight backs.'.We sing some scales.XYFNKWOur music lessons are a lot of fun.XYFNKWOur old teacher didn't let us sing in music lessons..There are some things in this world that are amazing.XYFNKWI love singing to a real piano.XYFNKWMiss Sunshine plays really well and then she gives us the music to Imagine by John Lennon.XYFNKWWe don't look at the words.XYFNKWWe know them.XYFNKWWe put the music down and sing from memory..Miss Sunshine asks if anyone would like to sing a solo.XYFNKWThe girls whisper 'Emma'.XYFNKWShy little Emma, who is clever and wears glasses, has a wonderful voice..And it's strange because now Dexter, Ajax, Blaze, Roxy and Iris are alone..They are miserable and we are smiling and having fun..At the end of the lesson Miss Sunshine collects the sheets of blank paper.XYFNKWShe tells them to stay behind..'I want to speak to each of you,' she says..'But we'll miss the school bus home,' says Iris.XYFNKW'My mum will be angry.'.'The driver will return and take you home later.XYFNKWI'll phone your parents and explain everything.'.Roxy gives Iris a killer look and they become even more miserable..For the first time, I run laughing out of school with Emma.XYFNKWWe are smiling and singing Imagine....CHAPTER FIVE..Feeling Good..The next morning we go into the music room.XYFNKWI don't know what Miss Sunshine said to Dexter and the others yesterday, but the mood is better.XYFNKWThere is more respect.XYFNKWRoxy and Ajax are sitting quietly.XYFNKWThey aren't sending text messages.XYFNKWBlaze isn't humming.XYFNKWDexter isn't rocking on two legs of his chair..I hope we are going to sing round the piano, but Miss Sunshine takes an unusual object from her bag.XYFNKW'This is a singing bowl,' she says.XYFNKW'When I run this wooden stick around the bowl, it makes a sound like a bell.XYFNKWThis bowl is very old.XYFNKWListen carefully until you can't hear the sound anymore.'.The singing bowl makes a mysterious sound.XYFNKWIt sings in my head.XYFNKWAbout a minute passes.XYFNKWThere is complete silence in the classroom..'What can you hear?' Miss Sunshine whispers..'Nothing at all, Miss,' says Emma..'Remember that there is silence in music too and moments of silence are important in our lives.XYFNKWSound and music can help and mindfulness helps your brain to work better.XYFNKWLet's make a brain.'.What!XYFNKWWe look at each other..'Put one hand in the air,' says Miss Sunshine.XYFNKW'Now put your thumb across and curl your fingers over the top - this is the brain.'.'Cool,' says Ajax..'The mind is complex.XYFNKWIt talks.XYFNKWSometimes there's a lot of stress in our heads.'.'My brain is always talking to me,' says Ajax..'That's fine, everyone's brain talks,' says Miss Sunshine.XYFNKW'We can help our brain relax when we are kind to other people.XYFNKWIt makes us feel good.'.'Singing makes me feel good.XYFNKWCan we sing again, Miss?' asks Ruby..'Of course we can.XYFNKWBring your chairs closer to the piano.'.Miss Sunshine gets us to sing some scales..Miss Sunshine asks Roxy to play the piano.XYFNKWRoxy looks shy at first and says she's too embarrassed to play in front of everyone..When Miss Sunshine says that Roxy can play some jazz, she jumps up.XYFNKWRoxy has got great rhythm.XYFNKWShe's really good.XYFNKWI didn't know she had this talent..We sing a song my mum likes, You've got a Friend by Carole King.XYFNKWI like the words of this song and singing together makes us feel more united as a class..Singing and mindfulness are helping.XYFNKWMy brain feels better by the end of class.XYFNKWI'm less stressed and more relaxed.XYFNKWWhen the bell rings, we skip to our next lesson....CHAPTER SIX..Fire!.Dexter and I sit near each other every day on the bus.XYFNKWWe get on and off at the same stop but he doesn't walk with me.XYFNKWHe walks far behind me.XYFNKWHe kicks stones along the road.XYFNKWI hurry ahead because I want to get home..I know where Dexter lives.XYFNKWI pass his house every day, but this afternoon as I look across his front garden, I stop..'Dexter,' I shout.XYFNKW'Quick.XYFNKWHurry!XYFNKWThere's a fire!' My voice is high.XYFNKWI am afraid..He starts to run.XYFNKWTogether we run towards the smoke and flames..'Who's in there?' I say..'Mum and my little sister.XYFNKWShe's only three.'.I pull my phone out of my pocket and dial 999.XYFNKWI shout 'fire' when they ask me what service I need.XYFNKWI try to breathe slowly and calm myself down.XYFNKWMy voice is shaking when I give them the address..Dexter opens the front door and there's lots of black smoke..'I'm going in,' he says..'Wait!' I run to an outside tap and hold my scarf under the water.XYFNKWI run back and tie the scarf around Dexter's nose and mouth.XYFNKWI pull my jacket up over my mouth.XYFNKW'I'm coming with you.'.He pushes me back.XYFNKW'No, you're not.XYFNKWIt's too dangerous.XYFNKWI know where mum and my sister will be.'.Then he goes inside and all I can do is cry and wait..One minute, two minutes pass.XYFNKWIt seems longer.XYFNKWThe fire brigade arrives, then two ambulances.XYFNKWDexter appears through the smoke.XYFNKWHe is carrying his sister.XYFNKWHis hands are burned, but he wants to go back for his mother..'Leave it to us,' says a fireman.XYFNKWFiremen pull Dexter away from the burning house.XYFNKWHe doesn't want to leave.XYFNKWThey lift Dexter and his sister into the ambulance and put on the emergency blue light.XYFNKWThat scares me..A fireman appears carrying a woman.XYFNKWAnd at that moment there's an explosion..'Move away from here.XYFNKWIt isn't safe.' A fireman says to me.XYFNKWI can smell fire on my clothes and in my hair.XYFNKWThere's nothing for me to do.XYFNKWI walk home..Dexter is away from school for ten days and when he returns he has bandages on his hands.XYFNKWEveryone is pleased to see him, especially Miss Sunshine..'How is your mother and your little sister?' she asks..Dexter smiles.XYFNKW'They're doing well.XYFNKWThe doctors are great.XYFNKWThey are still in hospital but they will be home soon.'.'So, you are living with your grandma.'.Dexter smiles again.XYFNKW'Yeah, she's lovely.XYFNKWWe'll be there for a while until the builders repair our house.'.'You were very brave, Dexter,' Miss Sunshine says..Dexter looks at his shoes.XYFNKW'Not really.XYFNKWI was scared when I went into the house.XYFNKWI couldn't see anything and it was really hot in there.'.'Do the police know what started the fire?' Miss Sunshine asks..'They don't know.' Dexter looks around the classroom for me.XYFNKW'Alice was there.XYFNKWShe gave me her scarf to put over my mouth.XYFNKWIt's the smoke that kills.XYFNKWYou saved my life.XYFNKWThanks, Alice.'.And our class cheer and I'm crying.XYFNKWDexter is looking down and trying not to cry..'I have something, for both of you.' Miss Sunshine gives Dexter a large package and a smaller one to me.XYFNKWDexter's is a violin a really good one.XYFNKWI can see he's pleased..'It's awesome!' he says.XYFNKW'I love it.'.'I don't play the violin anymore.XYFNKWI want you to play it.'.Miss Sunshine turns to the class.XYFNKW'I don't think you know that Dexter is very talented.XYFNKWHe plays jazz violin very well.'.She looks at Dexter.XYFNKW'You can't play at the moment.XYFNKWWill you play for us when your hands are better?'.Dexter smiles.XYFNKW'Of course.'.In my package there is a ukulele..'For the ukulele band we're starting,' Miss Sunshine says.XYFNKW'It's easy to learn and I want the band to play in the school musical.'.'A musical!' everyone says together.XYFNKWWe all smile....CHAPTER SEVEN..Everyone Has a Talent..My world is different and everything is better.XYFNKWWe all talk about the musical.XYFNKWWe don't walk to classes, we dance along the corridors.XYFNKWAjax, who's good with words, is writing the story and we practice the songs every day.XYFNKWOur voices are better, stronger with Miss Sunshine teaching us.XYFNKWMr Weak hums when he passes the music room..'Everyone has a talent.XYFNKWYou just have to find it,' Miss Sunshine says during our lesson..She's right.XYFNKWThere are so many people in our class who have a special talent.XYFNKWIris Fudge is a brilliant dancer.XYFNKWWe didn't know.XYFNKWI love watching her when she's dancing.XYFNKWShe becomes someone else, so beautiful and full of life.XYFNKWShe's practising after school every day with some girls who study ballet..People who are good at art are painting the scenery..And me?XYFNKWI'm singing in the chorus and learning the ukulele in my free time.XYFNKWI follow lessons online and I practise in my bedroom..Dexter is responsible for the orchestra and their rehearsals.XYFNKWHe's very musical.XYFNKWHe has a great feel for rhythm.XYFNKWAnd he's changed!XYFNKWHe's kind to people and that can make you feel good..And the funny thing is that Dexter is different physically too.XYFNKWHis eyes are not small and hard.XYFNKWThey are soft.XYFNKWHe looks taller, more responsible.XYFNKWHe smiles a lot.XYFNKWDexter is someone I can trust..He's playing the violin again now that his hands are better.XYFNKWThe sound he makes is beautiful.XYFNKWWhen he plays I feel happy..We travel home together on the bus and he talks about the music and performers he loves.XYFNKWHe wants to go to Music College in London when he finishes school..'How often do you practise?' I ask him..'Every day.XYFNKWAn hour before school and a couple of hours when I get home.'.'Wow!' I say..'If I work really hard, I'll pass the audition.'.'And then what?' I ask..'A career in music, I think,' he says.XYFNKW'I can play in an orchestra or form my own jazz group.XYFNKWWhat do you want to do, Alice?'.'I want to be a doctor,' I say in a small voice..We sit in silence for a minute and I start to panic.XYFNKWI'm expecting him to laugh and return to the old Dexter.XYFNKWBut he smiles..'You'll do it, Alice.XYFNKWIt won't be easy and you'll have to work hard, but I know you'll do it.'.And I'm not sure why, but I feel strange....CHAPTER EIGHT..The Talent Scout..There is no bullying anymore and there is more respect for the teachers.XYFNKWThe school magazine is all about the musical - interviews with the cast and with Ajax.XYFNKWThe story is about people who are different.XYFNKWWe can't all be the same.XYFNKWThe message is to be kind to someone every day.XYFNKWMost of all it is about the power of friendship..Tickets are sold out for all five performances and we are all excited.XYFNKWI'm playing the ukulele in one song and I'm singing in the chorus.XYFNKWThe songs make us happy.XYFNKWWe are full of confidence.XYFNKWSchool has a greater purpose..'This is your musical,' Miss Sunshine says.XYFNKW'Smile and enjoy the evening.'.We are nervous as we wait.XYFNKWIt's five minutes before the musical starts and I look round the curtain at the audience.XYFNKWThe concert hall is full.XYFNKWWhy have all those parents brought video cameras?The music starts.XYFNKWThis is it.XYFNKWWe step into another world of lights and costumes.XYFNKWAnd little shy Emma sings beautifully on stage.XYFNKWIt's a new and exciting experience.XYFNKWA live performance is very different.XYFNKWWe can hear the audience laugh and clap.XYFNKWIt's great to see their reaction.XYFNKWTheir eyes are wide, their faces are smiling, they are enjoying every moment.XYFNKWI can see my parents surprise when the chorus sings.XYFNKWWe are fantastic..We sing and dance for five nights.XYFNKWOn the first night Mr Weak gives flowers to Miss Sunshine and the other teachers.XYFNKWWe have a party.XYFNKWWe are happy!One morning Miss Sunshine comes into the music room.XYFNKWShe has something to tell us.XYFNKWShe closes her eyes until there's silence, then opens them again..'An American talent scout came to one of your performances.'.She can see we don't understand what a talent scout is.XYFNKWShe tries again.XYFNKW'A talent scout is someone who recognises great talent and promotes it.'.'Oooooh,' we all say..'His name is Addison Bell.XYFNKWHe's a friend of mine and he came to talk to me at the end of the musical.XYFNKWHe's American, from Los Angeles.XYFNKWHe wants to take your musical to Hollywood this summer!Silence.XYFNKWThen there are cheers and laughter and crying..'He thinks there's great talent in this show and he wants American children to hear your message of friendship,' Miss Sunshine says..The summer holidays arrive and we fly to Hollywood.XYFNKWLimousines pick us up at the airport.XYFNKWI feel like a celebrity when I walk the red carpet entrance to the Beverly Hills Hotel.XYFNKWIt's great.XYFNKWThere's a pool surrounded by palm trees in tropical gardens.XYFNKWDexter is happy because musicians play jazz in the restaurant.XYFNKWThere isn't much free time, but when we do have a moment we watch people and Lamborghinis in the city centre.XYFNKWRehearsals are going well and we will perform in a theatre..It's our first night tomorrow and we are all excited.XYFNKWI don't want this to end.XYFNKWI don't want to come back down to earth.XYFNKWBut with Miss Sunshine in our lives, what will happen next?And I suppose you think this is the end of my story, but not quite..Music is a powerful force and I love Dexter's violin playing.XYFNKWWe spend a lot of time together.XYFNKWWe watch the sunsets, we laugh and talk.XYFNKWWhen his hand touches mine and our fingers meet, we don't let go.."
